"When we first got this machine, it worked great!  However over time, the brewhead seal has become looser & looser and now after a few seconds of pressure building, the seal simply blows out and coffee grounds & water spray everywhere.It was cheap not only in price but construction.  The lesson:  You get what you pay for."
Loving my Capresso so much and their service even more!!! I put my filter sleeve in the dishwasher and unfortunitally the chrome finish dulled.After a quick email to the company I recieved a free new shiny part in the mail less than a week later.Highly recommend!!!!
"My boyfriend got a promotion at work and wanted to have his own Espresso Maker in his new office. This little machine works wonders! His coworkers have all sampled his freshly ground beans and are in love as well. Would be the perfect price, size, and quality for a gift as well."
"When I bought it from Amazon it did not work, but I was able to return it. It's a good machine though, I've had it before. Most probably I got the ONE defective machine of the lot."
"I bought it from the local Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  The price was $145, reduced to $120 on sale.I have had four espresso machines in the past 10 years.  Each machine lives about 2-3 years and dies ingloriously.My first impression: espresso comes out strong, with crema, as it should be.  Perhaps even a bit overdrawn (that is, too bitter - which means, the grounds are too fine; I will grind coarser from now on.)  The machine is on the lighter side, so when inserting the porta filter holder, you have to hold the machine down, or it will slide all over the counter.  Perhaps I will glue on some rubber stickers on it to increase traction.It warms up very quickly - less than a minute; and I don't do the ""warming porta filter ritual"" - I don't bother with that, and the coffee comes out very hot.  No worries.As to how long this machine is going to last... Oh boy, at the price of $140, I'd be happy if it lasts 2 years. I think they make them so short-lived so that we'd buy more of them.  After all, the manufacturer is not interested in making an espresso machine that lasts forever."
"I got this for my bf's birthday gift and he loves it. He would drink at least one double espresso everyday and after I got this for him, he never buys coffee in a cafe anymore. The only thing you have to keep in mind is that you need to have the right type of milk to make big froth for cappuccino. Skim milk and low fat milk work better. My bf and I use soy milk when making cappuccino; this adds a little different flavour to it but makes less froth.This makes a very good espresso. It might not good enough for those who are super sensitive to how espresso has to taste like and own an espresso machine that can buy a computer with the price but trust me this machine is worth having."
"water runs through coffee too fast.  Coffee is very weak.  I have tried very fine grind coffee and packed it tight, but still get weak coffee.  On the other hand, milk foam is easy to make with this machine and it turns out great every time."
I was pleasantly surprised at what a nice latte this machine makes. Very easy to use. Nice steamer. Easy clean up. Great price. Hope it lasts!
"The machine has enough power to push the steamy hot water through a pretty firmly packed coffee load.  The espresso comes out hot and flavorful, with a nice crema.  The water reservoir has ample supply for plenty of cups.  Cleanup between cups is easy.  In summary we are very satisfied with this machine."
"Working great so far. . .had nespresso, but back to using local roasters and loving the morning joe and the afternoon espresso"
"This little machine is great for making coffee latte and most espresso drinks. The coffee comes out flavorful, and the steam system is very powerful. It isn't as noisy as most Mr. Coffee espresso makers, and the materials are all better. It's also very easy to operate. I ended up getting another one for my office."
"This machine is just a bad joke. One star is too much to describe how bad it is.I tried to make the first cappuccino few days after getting the machine. One day before I tested the frother and seemed to be fine.Next day I made an espresso  then I tried to froth the milk. Stayed about 5 minutes with the pipe in the cup and nothing happened, only some noise from the pump. 15 minutes later I tried again and it seemed to work, but was too late. My guess is that it is not able to do an espresso and froth the milk, it needs a pause. But, what's the point then?"
This machine performs as promised.  I really like it.  The only thing I don't like is that the machine doesn't  automatically turn off.  I have left it on numerous times.  I also appreciate that I can take out the tray and use a regular coffee mug and can easily see (and fill) the water reservoir.
"I live in Italy, so I'm familiar with what a cup of espresso should taste like. I don't add sugar, I don't make lattes. I just drink coffee. If you practice at it (it takes a few cups to get to know the machine), then this machine makes decent espresso. Its a 4 star cup, because to get a 5 star cup you need to spend $200. I got this machine on sale for $75. When I'm really craving the perfect cup of espresso, I go to the bar (coffee shop) and get one there.The trick I've learned: make sure your grounds are actually the really fine espresso grounds. Make sure you actually fill it with grounds so you have to tamp it down. And about 10 seconds. And the longer I've used it, the slower it flows, and the better coffee it makes."
"Very nice machine, easy to use .steam wand simple to clean. Quickly prepares hot espresso with very good crema. I did not expect this much quality for the price. Cup warming plate of insignificant value."
"The EC 100 Pump Expressoo machine met all my expectations. Reliable, easy to use and fun to have expresso whenever I want without costing a fortune."
It makes excellent espresso. If you prime it first the espresso is very hot with the perfect crema. It's a little loud but other than that it fully meets my expectations.
"Affordable, easy to use, consistent.  Make sure you clean everything periodically to ensure it continues to work well into the future.  Everyone loves this machine.  Yes, the water draining into the pan is a pain and a bad design.  Don't go any larger than a 12 ounce foaming container.  No need for a more expensive machine."
I'm not sure how I survived mornings without this amazing machine.  It is easy to use and renders delicious coffee.  I use the frothing mechanism with soymilk and couldn't be happier.
"Makes decent coffee, however after weeks of use steam leaks out of coffee area instead of steam wan.  You will lose steam pressure and cannot properly froth yr milk.  Good customer service.  Got a new unit with no questions asked.  However new unit had the same problem after 1 week use.  Had to return the machine because I want to use steam feature."
"After purchasing this machine, I had to do a lot more homework on espresso machines because this one wasn't cutting it for my primary use: making silky milk for lattes.First, this uses a thermo block to heat the water/steam.This takes a long time to steam milk that is silky enough (about three minutes). It just barely swirls the milk. After trying one with a boiler for heating instead, the steam pressure is so much better. It doesn't cost much more to get one with a boiler.Not bad but there are better ones for the money."
This my second Espresso machine first one was low cost steam machine. Which made ok espresso but kept burning self when adding water for second or third brew. The Capresso solved this problem. Machine heats up fast even when I first get up n the winter months. It makes a lot of cream maybe to much and your breed espresso isn't  as hot as it should be. If it is . brewing correctly the coffee sb at least 180' the frother wand is to short to froth milk if your needing more a couple Cappachino. Really is a great machine for cost but will save up enough money not going to Starbucks I should be able to buy a $1000 machine.
This is a really good machine which is great because I've always been told that you can't a good espresso maker for less than a fortune. Really easy to set up and use and it makes really good espresso with the grounds I get (Cafe Bustello - so much better than that starbucks garbage).The only problems I find are with the heating mechanism. You have to wait a good 10 mins after turning it on to get it hot enough to get the coffee to come out at a decent temperature. And the steamer also doesn't really heat the milk up all that much (though it does make good froth). I usually have to steam the milk at least 2 times to get it how I want it.Overall a great buy for the casual espresso drinker.
"I spent a more than a year with two of these machines. Side by side. First they produced  pretty okay thick espresso and foamy coffee. Eventually, within about six months, the motor got jittery on one model. The second model kept running but coffee began to taste worse and worse. I tried to clean the machine and it ceased to be. The other machine was cleaned but leaks. I read to treat all non manual home espresso machines as disposable within a year or two, but didn't want to believe. Here we are now. Espressoless.The machine leaked after a brew, the pull was finicky, the frother more bubbles than froth, but together we made some good coffee once. I would not buy again as I would want 15 bar pressure for real espresso, but an okay machine for beginners in the art. Sad our time has ended."
"We have enjoyed this machine, the espresso product is excellent in body and taste. We have owned Capresso machines in the past find this one to be better and considerably less expensive"
This is a great espresso machine. The lattes I make are better than Starbucks!
"Ok, mine is white and believe it or not hubby & bff chipped in to give it to me as a birthday gift in 1987.1.  I still have all the original parts except for the carafe.  Clean as recommended right after each use and occasional vinegar brewing to remove mineral deposits.2.  It still makes a great cup of expresso, cappucino, latte and we use it a minimum of 4x a week.  Hubby is definitely addicted.3.  I've bought 3 different cheaper brands and none lasted longer than a year.4.  It still cost about the same as when they bought it for me way back when.Definitely the best buy ever."
"AWESOME LITTLE DOOHICKY. MAKES PRETTY STRONG CONCENTRATED EXPRESSO, ESPECIALLY IF YOU USE CAFFE BUSTELLO...LOL. OVERALL IT'S A GOOD BRAND COFFEE/EXPRESSO MACHINE."
"This machine can make delicious espresso with very little practice. That is most important. The photo shows the crema I got on the very first day. I think that was around my fifth try. Some other things worth knowing about this machine:1. You MUST prime the machine by pulling a blank shot (running it without grounds). Otherwise the parts will not be warm enough. So just turn it on for a bit, let it drip into a cup, turn it off, and dump out the water. If you don't do that, you will not get a great espresso shot. (It's right there in the instructions, but it seems some reviewers don't read the instructions.)2. This comes with a combo scoop/tamper. The scoop part is fine, but the tamper part is inadequate to the task. It's plastic, flimsy and smaller in diameter than it should be. You should get a 51 mm stainless steel replacement tamper. They run $14.50. I bought my tamper on Amazon, and it fit perfectly: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B703BNU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=13. The scoop is not 2 tablespoons. So if you get a replacement scoop, keep that in mind. It's 1.5 tablespoons.4. If the steam stops working, the wand might be clogged with old milk. Clear it with a needle (as the instructions say). This happened to me after eight days. (A toothpick might break off. So use a needle ... carefully.)5. If you overfill the sieve (basket), you might not be able to make a proper seal between the portafilter and the grouphead, and water will pour out over the sides, maybe even spray a little. So be careful about how much you fill it. You don't want to wreck the gasket. (This seems to be true of all machines. Read the one-star reviews of even the most expensive models, and there are always problems with coffee spraying out.)6. Remember to change out the drip tray every few cups or so. It fills up from overflow from the boiler pretty quickly.7. The cup warming area is big enough to hold four small ceramic espresso cups or two double espresso cups (like the Bodum double-wall cups, as seen in the picture). It will not actually warm your cups much.8. The water reservoir is removable. Just lift straight up.9. Warming up from a cold start in the morning is very quick, around 15 or 20 seconds.10. The portafilter sits just barely high enough to accommodate a good-sized latte cup (mine are Bodum latte cups, which are fairly huge.)11. It took a little while for this to occur to me, so maybe it will save you some time: If you like Americanos, you can get hot water form a blank shot and use the steamer to warm it more if you like a higher temp.12. Be careful not to tamp your grounds with the portafilter resting on a counter top. Otherwise you might break the portafilter or strip the screw that holds the plastic part inside it. Also you might just want to check the tightness on that screw when you unpack it to make sure it isn't loose.13. The double sieve and single sieve are two totally different animals. Practice with both.14. The portafilter has two openings, whether you're making a single or a double. Get used to it. It's no big deal.15. Always use filtered water.16. DON'T clean/decalcify the machine with vinegar. It will damage the seals. (See the instructions.)17. This does not stop brewing on its own. You decide when the shot is the right size for your tastes. For one level scoop of grounds, a single shot can be anywhere from one ounce of liquid (2 tablespoons or 1/8 of a cup) to about 1.5 ounces (3 tablespoons).18. Read the instructions. They are available online. http://www.capresso.com/media/wysiwyg/EC100_IB_WEB.pdf"
"This is the best home Espresso Machine for the money. You can do cup after cup, with no problems, it froths the milk better than any of the others I have tried in this price range. It really puts out a good cup of espresso."
"Super pleased with this! It really speeds up the entire process, and having the reservoir on the back is awesome! I got this as a present for my parents, and they have both enjoyed it immensely. It's very easy to use, makes good espresso, and the frothing is excellent. If you're ready to upgrade a bit, this is a great step!"
"Machine works great (both brewer and steamer). The grounds are difficult to shake out of the filter and no matter what amt used or time passed after infusion, they still refuse to be tapped out of the reservoir. Maybe just my machine...?"
For the price this does what I expect. I wish the frother was longer to allow for more milk at a time. It is easy to clean and run.
Makes great coffee!
Returning as the steam only runs for about 10 seconds.
"This is a very nice home unit.  The water reservoir is large enough to make many cups between fills.  Pre-heat is quick.  The espresso process is quick and neat.  Good crema.  I love the steamer.  It does a great job and is long enough to get down in the pitcher so I can control the amount of foam.  The top heater is a nice feature, though I tend not to use it that much as I generally bring a cup to the machine from somewhere else.  Clean up is easy.  Only one size grounds cup may be inconvenient for some, I don't need the option.  I recommend this machine unless you're opening a shop."
"Poorly constructed, filter clogs frequently, part broke on unit and the jura people won't sell you a replacement part-they only want you to send it in for repair for $$$.  Will not buy again."
"I have no idea how anyone could like this machine.It only holds a very small cup, the basket is hard to put in and take out, the coffe is cold, the milk frother is awful.I MUCH prefer my ol $29.99 stema driven machine.This piece of junk is going back to the store."

I am a first time buyer of a espresso machine. I read lots of reviews before buying. Even though this machine had a lot of negative reviews it also had a lot of positive ones. It works great and have no complaints.
"I bought this Expresso machine 2 years ago.It works like clockwork. It makes a lot of crema, every time.Most mugs are 10 -11 cm tall and don't fit under any Expresso machine. You can fit a cup 8 1/2 cm tall directly under this one. Starbucks had mugs that tall, it saves pouring the coffee from one to another vessel. It is quicker, the coffee warmer that way.I use Starbucks coffee and have it ground on the setting:""expresso number 4"".I have bee complimented by visitors on my great coffee and the crema my ExpressCE110 makes."
Came broken.
"I give this Capresso Espresso machine 5 stars because of its excellent performance relative to its price. I owned a much older Capresso machine for nearly 10 years and, as I recall, paid nearly as much then for that machine as I paid for my new one. The pump is efficient and extracts an excellent espresso essence with frothy crema. I'm now skeptical about why those needing a home machine opt for the pricy machines that run five times the retail cost of this one. It would be difficult to convince me that such machines would be five times better!"
"I've had this Capresso now for over 3 years (maybe more!).  I actually got it as an exchange for a Delonghi that stopped working (they no longer made that model so got this higher priced one as replacement from Bed Bath & Beyond).  I use the double espresso cup and make two shots.  Only complaint is that the espresso could be hotter.  I don't use the steaming wand because I have a Nespresso for that and it's super quiet and fast.  This is one of the best machines I've had in this price range.  Easy to clean, and even with our hard water here, there isn't much residue, just a damp cloth and it looks nice and clean.  Really like the high quality stainless on it too.  Not a bad footprint on the counter either.  I just get the Starbucks espresso ground for espresso and it works really well.  Excellent crema.  For the price you can't go wrong."
"nice machine for the price, need to use dark fine ground expresso coffee to get the full flavor, also need to press down the coffee with the tool that came with the machine."
I love this Espresso machine.  Poors an excellant shot with little trouble.
The best espresso machine I got. A lot of creamy and good taste espresso. It must be cleaned every 2 months.
"My wife purchased this machine along with a burr grinder for me last month. I had guarded optimism with this machine due to its pressurized portafilter basket. I used it for about three weeks until the handle to the portafilter basket completely broke off from the basket when I went to lock it in to brew a cup of espresso. After inspection of the handle I realized it's cheap powdered metal construction was the culprit. When the machine did function properly it made okay espresso, albeit on the weak side. It seems to prefer the fourth notch of my grinder, any more coarse and the espresso taste like drip coffee, any more fine and the espresso taste extremely sour due to over extraction. The milk frothing wond makes decent foam, although I recommend using it without the frothing attachment. With a little technique you can froth small quantities of milk with the wand by itself and it produces more of a micro bubble than the frothing wand does.I would highly recommend using anunpressurized basket along with tamping to produce a good cup of espresso with this machine, that along with a gentle hand while locking in the portafilter.Knowing what I know now I would most likely not purchase this machine again due to the cheap materials it's mad of."
"This coffee machine has made me so happy I can't stop singing every time I make an espresso. The crema is beautiful, the instructions are very nice, the design is compact and amicable and everything from preparing the espresso to cleaning the machine is easy and comfortable. I also appreciate so much that you shipped it all the way to Mexico. Thank you!"
Love this machine. The easiest I've ever owned.
"SECOND UPDATE - 3/2015:  The machine was in the repair shop for two months.  The owner said he could not locate a replacement thermostat.  I looked on line and found many thermostats for coffee machines.  They all looked similar - like enlarged watch batteries.  I took a chance and ordered one for $15.I picked up the espresso machine from the repair shop.  At home I decided to figure out how to get inside to if the thermostat that I ordered would work.  It was not a problem to open the machine.  Under the stainless plate on top are four plugs with screws under them.  I removed the top and located the thermostats.  Much to my surprise while looking around I found a loose connection at one thermostat.  I replaced the push-on connection that was loose with a new connector (no soldering needed) and tried the machine.  IT WORKS GREAT!  The thermostat has not arrived yet but I do not need it.  Bottom line, aService has NO customer service and could not be bothered with me, and the repair shop evidently did not even look inside the machine.  This shop could have picked up an easy $25 - $35 in repair charges for 5 minutes work.The machine is making great espresso with crema every morning, the steamer is fast and makes lots of foam with cold 2% milk.  The machine is simple and cheap, but now works five stars.  I cannot raise my rating to more than three stars due to the loose connection and the bad customer service.  I am in the market for a grinder and found exactly what I wanted.  When I checked the suppler on the Amazon site it was ""aService"" - no thank you.  Not again in my lifetime.  I bought the grinder elsewhere.UPDATE:  The machine was working great, then several days ago it produced only warm coffee.  When the machine was working it was every bit as good as I said in this review.  The machine now produces steam, so I think the thermoblock heater is OK.  With the low cost of this espresso machine, it is probably not worth repairing.  I received very little value for money spent.I wish it was still working and I was attempting to locate repair parts.  I inquired to aSavings, the Amazon seller about where to buy parts.  My inquiry to aService was simply asking for help locating repair parts.  I also asked them if they have encountered this problem with other units.I believe aSavings DID NOT BOTHER TO READ MY INQUIRY!  I received a form letter e-mail from aService saying the unit was ""out of warranty"" and there was nothing aService will do for me.I was not asking aService to return item or for warranty repair because I know that the warranty is expired.  I liked the machine very much and wanted to see if it could be repaired at reasonable cost locally (if parts are available). I tried looking on the Capresso web site and there were no parts listed.  I thought aService would help me.  aService evidently considers the form letter as ""customer service"".If you are searching for a simple machine that will provide good cappuccino, this might be for you.  In the past 5 years I have spent around $1,500 on espresso machines.  My first was Breville  650EXL (perhaps not exact model - trashed long ago).  The circuit board went out and this was a big deal for the shop to order part and repair.  The repair took so much time I bought another Breville (Stupid, I know!)  This new machine worked for a short while and then a small plastic pressure relief valve on the pump broke and the repair people said, ""the part is no longer available.""  Nothing now but a high tech door stop. I continued to use the repaired Breville that I bought first, but the ""die cast"" finish completely fell apart.  First there were little pits that looked like dirt and then it became worse and worse until it looked like dumpster trash and so that is where it went!I bought a Cuisinart 200 and loved it at first.  It is a good machine, but I am experiencing the same problem as others that own the Cuisinart 200.  The machine has a tendency to develop an internal leak that directs..."
"My Capresso EC100 quit working while still under warranty, the factory sent me a re-conditioned replacement which made it until just past the warranty period and died. Don't waste your money on this brand/model."
Coffee cold!  Had to microwave cups and run two pots. Still getting use to it! Hate cold coffee!
"I had an espresso maker awhile ago and it lasted for a long time but finally I needed to replace it.  I procrastinated for a few years then finally decided I missed my morning cappuccino and researched a variety of machines.  I decided on the Capresso and am very happy with it.  It is easy to use, makes great espresso and froths milk for cappuccino just the way I like it.  The Capresso heats up very quickly so it is easy to make a few cups one after the other.  I like the quality of the machine too.  Clean-up is quick and easy.After grinding the coffee beans in my old grinder I realized I wasn't getting a fine enough grind so I invested in the Capresso burr grinder and now it is perfect.  I recommend getting one of those along with the espresso maker.I'm very happy with my purchase and am again enjoying a cappuccino everyday.  What a luxury!"
We have been making cafe with this 3-4 times a week. it works great. The only draw back is a little of the water that comes out at first when you start to foam and heat your milk.
"My first Capresso (a 112) was my trusted companion for over a decade.  When it finally died in 2013, instead of fixing it, Capresso offered me a trade-in deal on an EC100.  I had been impressed by their product and customer service, so I was happy to take their suggestion.Mistake.  The design of this machine has cut too many corners, and the company no longer offers the impeccable customer service it once did.  After I managed to get the grind right (which took a while - this machine seemed more sensitive than my old one), I started getting steam, hot water, and even coffee-ground slurry leaking from the head.  Customer service sent me a replacement silicone O-ring, which fixed it, but I was shocked that the design could allow this (the original O-ring was not damaged, and only a few weeks old).Then after a year of use, the machine stopped working altogether.  To their credit, Capresso replaced the machine free of charge, but still this was not a confidence-inspiring experience.Now my replacement machine is consistently leaking hot water and steam from the O-ring.  Capresso are happy to send me another replacement O-ring ... but now they're charging me $12.50.  Not a fortune, but a discouraging sign, and a bit of a slap in the face for what seems like a product flaw more than a consumable part (I don't recall ever needing to replace the seal on my 112).I tried to figure out why the O-ring is leaking at all.  There's a very small area of contact between the metal basket and the O-ring, which seems like a design weakness.  Plus, the part that the basket holder locks into is made of hard plastic, not the metal you'd expect for a high-pressure joint.I think Capresso went too far trying to cut the cost of this machine.  It looks like their more expensive EC Pro has a proper metal socket for the basket.  But now my confidence in and loyalty to Capresso are shaken, so I think I'll look for a different brand."
"This is a really good machine. I thought I would get that out of the way in case you decided to read no further. I want to run down the specifics of this machine as best as I can.The first thing that you need to know about this machine is that it brews a really fast cup of espresso. For some connoisseurs, this could prove to be an issue. As a trained barista I can tell you that the resulting espresso from this machine is good, but not perfect. The machine will produce a very large volume of crema. The downfall is that you are probably not getting the full extraction from your beans. In order to circumvent this you will need to do two things. First you need to have a burr grinder. If you are investing in an espresso machine and you do not have a conical burr grinder then you probably don't know how to make good espresso and you should watch a youtube video like the one from Alton Brown. Secondly you need to have a tamp. The tamp/scoop that comes with the machine just doesn't cut it. I bought this one - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DTF0W0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1 - and it works great.Once you have all of your tools then you can start making decent espresso with this machine. The major issue I have found with the quick extraction is the portafilter basket. If it just had one central hole instead, like most machines, instead of being fully perforated, then it would extract slower. Another thing is this black plastic frother. Throw it away. No professional uses this thing. The stainless steel steam wand works perfectly all on its own. Watch a youtube video to learn how.All and all a solid little machine at a very affordable price. If I could find a replacement all stainless steel portafilter with a smaller basket then this would be a perfect all around machine."
"This is my first espresso machine and I'm quite satisfied. I've tried it with lavazza and Illy espresso, both created great creama. Espresso comes out quite hot, machine heats up quickly. I've used it almost every day for a couple of months now. The steaming wand is quite loud and does take a little while to make the milk quite hot. The frothing attachment works pretty well for making foam. For the price, I think it's a great machine that makes good espresso. Saves me from spending money at starbucks, tastes better too."
Simply amazing. Excellent product. Prompt customer service. Just maintain it periodically and enjoy the luxury of Espresso coffee. Truly a delight for coffee lovers. Highly recommended.
"I bought this to use while I was on vacation since no one in my family drinks espresso besides me.  I am very happy with it.  It makes an amazingly good espresso macchiato.  I use beans and grind them in a normal coffee grinder.  I had to experiment a bit to get it the way I like.  I let the grinder run until I can't hear any more noise from the beans.  It takes about 30 seconds on with my grinder (This is longer than you might think.  Be patient.).  I use the double basket, fill it full, tamp it down firmly and then add some more grounds to the top of the basket and press it firmly again.  After putting it on the machine, I place a clear plastic measuring cup (2oz) with milliliter markings under the basket.  I run the machine until the crema hits the 60ml mark and turn it off.  Some of the crema will break down into coffee, but you will have just under 2 oz of coffee.  I found this does not work well with the single serving basket.  You need to buy a real tamper because the one that comes with the machine can't take the pressure necessary for the grounds and it is too small for the basket."
Fast; makes good coffee. The only problem is that in order to fit our normal size mugs under the spout required us to remove the grill on which they should stand and replace it with a sponge. Or we could get smaller mugs.
"I love it, the best, it is worth every penny. After trying a couple times a got the best coffee ever"
"I received this today and cleaned it and used it, it heats quickly, and steams and froths beautifully.  In reading other reviews I think this machine will do perfectly for what I was hoping.  A mid line espresso machine.  I am looking forward to winter much more now."
"Looks and performs exactly as advertised.  I have had no issues whatsoever though I have only been using it a couple of months--but experience suggests this is going to be basically as long-lived as any of these things.  If you want a hotter brew, run one empty cycle through first.  And so far as the frother goes, all of them have their quirks.  I suggest you buy a stand alone heater frother ($40-60)--you will be amazed at the ease and reliability of your drinks."
I am still getting use to it.  I like the froth quality better then my old Capresso but on the whole I like my old one better.I will give it time.
"My life has changed now that I can have morning macchiato at home! Easy to use, small counter footprint. Love it!"
"This is the easiest to use espresso/cappuchino maker I've owned, and I've owned plenty.The frother works very well with no fuss, not bad to clean either.The only thing I dislike about it it the basket is made of some cheap potmetal or something. It was horribly corroded within a couple of weeks. liveable but plastic would have been preferable to this cheap stuff."
"This is a very stylish machine and I was very excited to give it to my husband for his birthday. I made tiramisu and invited friends over for the evening thinking it would be fun to have wine, espresso, and dessert.From what we can gather this machine has major quality control issues. Right out of the box when we started trying to brew the espresso it started pouring water out of the bottom. Sounds like one of the internal seals is malfunctioning. And they have tamper-proof screws on it so that you can't just open it up and check on what's happening.  We put the unit on top of a bowl to catch the water and tried running it a couple of times, just in case. Same problem every time.I bought it at Bed Bath & Beyond so I will take it back and exchange for the same unit, then report back to see if it happens again. The price and style are just right, now if it will only function!UPDATE:  I exchanged for the exact same model and the new one works great! I think they just have some quality control problems in the factory with this particular model.It makes a great crema and is very fast at brewing. I'm having lots of fun experimenting with coffee drinks (Godiva Chocolate Liquer Macchiato anyone?). I can't help but wonder if some of the reviews below are because of poor beans/grinds vs. the actual machine not brewing a tasty cup. I tried a Safeway Select bean that I didn't like, and then the Pete's Coffee Espresso Forte which makes a very tasty cup. I like a very strong, dark flavor with just a little bite behind it. Espresso should be relatively strong compared to coffee and the beans make all of the difference."
"I am a coffee fan, but until I started making Americano in this machine, I didn't realize how delicious coffee could be. The crema is thick and creamy, the espresso smooth and not bitter, and everyone who has been a guest in my home has asked me how in the world I made their coffee taste so good.The machine is easy to use and clean, has reliable results and does a great job overall. Several friends now want to purchase one because they see how simple it is to operate, not intimidating with too many dials and buttons, and the consistent results speak for themselves.  You won't be sorry.  So many of the high end machines are so fussy and are full of options that you won't use often and for the few times you want them, you can achieve with a little research.  Why pay hundreds more for options you won't use?  This makes great espresso, froths and steams milk.I did have to test around to find the perfect coffee and grind but since then, no changes at all.  I use the World Market Italian roast, ground using the machine in the store- dial turned to the second notch on the espresso setting (just before ""Turkish"" grind"")  I make a double shot using the larger cup and then add an equal parts hot water to make the best Americano I've ever had.  The espresso also makes delicious iced coffee:  double shot of espresso, stir in sugar while hot (to dissolve sugar) and then fill glass with ice and stir or shake.  The melting ice cools the coffee and I add cream and go.  I'm so addicted, I now have a tray of coffee cubes in the freezer for my afternoon fix."
"Qick heat up, new improved espresso filter design and compact good looks make this espresso maker a winner.  In the past Capresso products have always performed exceptionaly well with company standing behind their product."
"I wanted to try a pump machine, after many years of using steam machines always with a more-or-less bitter tasting coffee. This Capresso sounded good in the descriptions, but I had some doubts  because of other reviews, although several of them sounded like they might not have been running the machine properly - lots of ""leaks"" but never where the leak was coming from, etc. So I bought one to try it out, and have used it regularly for the past few weeks.I am VERY happy with it. It took several days of mess and experiment to understand how it works - and I actually read the manual, surprise surprise. It is well-wriiten, much easier to understand and much, much more complete than the usual foreign-languag-ey kind of thing. The machine makes excellent espresso, and its foamer works beautifully, makes a nice long-lasting foam - I don't know how it works, my experience with the old inexpensive steam machines was pretty bad. One of the best things about the Capresso is that you can make as many capuccinos as you want, one after another, without waiting for anything to re-heat or cool down or be cleaned and refilled!! They have some kind of internal hot-block and they pump the water through it in one way to make the espresso and in another way to make the steam for foaming - there's no ""boiler"", when you shut off the steam it just stops!! And that's where the ""leak"" review must have originated. Because there's no boiler (so you can keep making them one after another until you need to replenish the water tank!) what they do when you shut off the foaming is to release the steam pressure in the foaming pipe into the drip-tray - so you get the last puff of steam and hot water into the tray. After 2 or 3 capuccinos the tray is full. Since I have to put fresh coffee grounds in for each new cup (duh!), I just empty the tray at the same time - saves thinking about it.Anyhow, I don't know how sturdy it is, etc etc, but it doesn't  seem to be fragile or flimsy, so I have hopes that it will last. In the meantime, we'll just enjoy the coffee!"
.The Capresso EC Pump ESpresso and Cappuccino Machine does not heat and form as well as our first Cappuccino did.
This is easy to use and makes very good espresso and capuccino. Both making the coffee and cleaning the machine is easy.
"Great machine when it was working properly.  Espresso tastes fine when using the right beans, makes plenty of crema.  Warms up fairly quickly.  Good price.  Easy to use.  The frothing head requires absolutely no skill at all to make thick foam.  Lotta plastic.  Apparently too much plastic because the plastic valve (the one that selects coffee, standby or steam) is leaking.  Now when I make steam, a significant amount of steam leaks thru the coffee head.  I cannot recommend this machine at any price because it didn't survive one year of average home use.  It is very frustrating that manufacturers design products to fail instead of last.  There is no reason that a home espresso machine can't last 5-10 years.  This one went back under warranty and I exchanged it for a Saeco Poemia, waiting for triple-B to ship it to me.  BTW, my backup machine is a Mr. Coffee ECMP50.  It cost 1/2 the bucks and has proven to be more reliable."
"This little machine makes a perfectly perfect expresso. I am a tough customer too. When I read the reviews for the machine I was almost scared away by the reviews that implied that the persons giving lots of stars were clueless or lacked taste. I now agree with those who suggest that the not so convinced people likely do not know how to make it. Making expresso is a science. The correct grind, the freshness of beans and grinding seconds before it is made all contribute to a perfect cup of expresso. I went for it, (despite some of the bad reviews) anyway because the machine I purchased was a refurbished one for $64.00. I have had the machine since January. The Miele I keep at my office. If I want a perfect cup, I make it at home!!"
"My pervious espresso machine from Capresso lasted a good ten years and was used almost every day.  But, I wore it out.  This replacement has some nice improvements.  The biggest is the seal to the espresso basket.  It is so much easier to clean!  I also think the pump functions better too.  I don't bother using the frothing attachment as it produces way to much froth.  Enjoy!"
"Bought this refurbished coffee maker for 30% below the new price, so far we have had no technical issues.We have had it now 10 days, with approximately 4 expresses per day. The brew time is super fast and has a double drip for two espressos at once and the milk frother makes awesome frothed milk, hot and ample amount, keep in mind to use at least 2% for a really good expresso. The cups we use are 31/2oz, so they are small servings but robust, you will start your day like a jet engine and have lots if energy for your daily tasks at hand.Don't look at this machine as a regular coffee maker it is not, it is designed for the standard cup of expresso, of course you can always put one cup instead of two and double your dose of caffeine......we love it.If you buy refurb just make sure you have one kind of warranty, we had 30 days.NEW REVIEW AFTER USING: Well despite making great coffee and working fine, after about 15 days it started sputtering water from where the coffee holder/handle inserts into the machine so I am really disappointed and shall return for an oppertunitie for them to fix it. I shall give a follow up review when we get the machine back:-( I'm still giving a two star bc the frother is amazing!"
"But our arrived with a leaking seal and had to be replaced. Otherwise, it's a fine coffee maker. Looks good on countertop."
"Although this is my first at home machine, I am glad to say I am in love with my new Christmas gift.  This little machine had me fooled.  I didn't think there was any way it could create great espresso.  I was pleasantly wrong.  The only thing I would like to make clear is that you need to grind your beans fine and pack them well.  I highly recommend purchasing a tamper other than the plastic one it comes with.  The plastic one does not allow for the proper lbs. of pressure to be used."
"I purchased this after my last Capresso died and have had it for two months and made at least one latte every day.  The unit does make good coffee although it does not take the automatic ""Espresso"" grind so many places produce.  I have needed to adjust it, and finally bought a Capresso ceramic burr grinder to solve my issues.  It takes extra effort to clean the tube the foaming attachment is fixed on, it makes much better foam than the previous model, it would be nicer if the ""wand"" was easier to clean.  I am very happy with the unit and have recommended it to two friends who also recently purchased one and also like theirs."
This is a good quality product that is very easy to use and seems very durable. We are pleased and satisifed with the value for the price.
"I wanted an espresso machine that could make quality espresso/cappuccino..... but I didn't have alot of money to spend.  I had read good reviews on this and took a chance. SO glad I did, love this machine!  Works very well, and the espresso is delicious with awesome crema....just like the coffee shops....highly recommend this machine!"
My friend daughter loves it
great toy but a little heavy for a 2~3 years old
"The EC100 is a nicely designed machine, EXCEPT it makes a weak product. I'm sure this is all because of the sieve/basket design which is multipart with plastic and rubber parts. I guess they do this to make it do lots of crema. If capresso would offer a normal, noncute basket, all metal with a tiny holes, it would correct the problem and make me very happy with my purchase. As is I will repair my last machine and put this one on a shelf in my shed...:(Since writing the review above I purchased a ""single wall"" basket from breville.com. I now use the new basket with the capresso EC100. The ""normal"" designed basket allows the EC100 to make consistently great espresso."
"Capresso EC100 Pump Espresso and Cappuccino MachineWe LOVE good espresso!  I also am thrifty financially!  We had had a Capresso Espresso machine for about 12 years.  Loved it!  That's why we looked into Capresso when it needed replacing.  Got his machine, knowing we could return it if not happy.  I had read unfavorable reviews about how it produced too much crema and not enough espresso.  This was in fact the case :(  So, we called Capresso and they recommended trying a coffee ground with a burr grinder.  Well, waa-laa....that did it.  Now we get a nice blend of both crema & espresso.  And the crema is fantastic!  The size and look of the machine are perfect for our kitchen.  I am not thrilled about the little notch on the basket that needs to be lined-up with the handle, but am getting used to it.  Enjoyin' espresso again :)"
"This is our 3rd Capresso in the last 15 years.  The last one was a refurbished and can't say I was very impressed with its 2 years of use we got from it.  So, I would not purchase another refurbished one.  But this one seems to be designed totally different.  It produces a froth like no other machine.  It is also the 1st one that can actually push through actual espresso ground beans from Starbucks easily!  It is also much quieter than previous models. So, 4 stars so far!"
"The quality of the espresso is very good; perfect crema. And the milk frother works very well.  However, the size of the 2-cup coffee sieve is barely enough to make 1 cup of espresso, much less 2 cups, and certainly not enough to make a strong enough cup of cappuccino.  Capresso could have easily designed the porta filter large enough to accommodate a larger sieve.  I sometimes make two batches of espresso for one cup of cappaccino to get the right concentration and volume, but what a pain.  Otherwise, makes a quality cup of espresso."
Makes lattes quickly and efficiently.  We switched from our other latte machine because it filtered water through aluminum.  The only complaint is that the coffee isn't as strong.
Excellent product. It would be easier to state its shortcomings than its successes. I've only owned for a month so I can't say how it will do over time but the parts that matter seem designed to last.1. warmer doesn't really do much warming2. The cup holding tray doesn't stay situated - but it does catch run-off water and coffee well.
"I was very hesitant purchasing this machine.  However, the first cup of what I call Cappuchino/Latte was the best I've ever had.  The first thing I do in the morning is turn it on so it heats up.  I allow it to do so for 30 min.  By the time my Capresso is ready, so am I.  It pumps very quickly.  Always very hot and tasty.  My cup of milk is frothed in 1 min...the machine is made in France, and believe me they take their manufacturing much more seriously than we do in the USA.  You are not going to beat the price of this baby anywhere.  Even if you're thinking of starting out with an el cheapo Mr Coffee Espresso...stop and think again.  For another $20-$40....you can have one of these, which is 100 times better.  I KNOW...I just threw my $37.00 Walmart special Mr Coffee in the trash!  Even if this one stops working, I'll buy another.  Cheers!!"
"Had it for about a week, and then it started pouring water out of the seal on the outside of the steel cup where the Lock and Insert words are printed on the plastic. A little frustrating considering it was a Christmas gift. Will have to find out how to warranty repair/replace it.It still makes decent espresso even when it makes a huge mess."
"As I sit here sipping the coffee I just made on my Capresso, EC100, I have to admit that my husband is correct -- it isn't Starbucks. As metropolitan Seattle residents, we understand coffee quality. Still, it isn't a bad cup of coffee. I've been served worse. And it is cheaper than going out for coffee.For the good news -- it froths a rich, creamy top.The downside is that the top froth is the top 3+ inches of the cup, and if one waits until the froth settles, the coffee is not real hot. The temperature is another mediocre result. You won't have to wait to sip this cup of coffee. In fact your throat would be reasonably safe if you were to gulp the contents right away. No cautions required here, if you are an accustomed coffee drinker.The further downside is that the cup size is SHORT. The photo associated with the product makes it look like you can put a tall cup under the spouts, and make your latte or Americano there. Not true. At 3 and 5/8"" my cup just fits under, and I have to tip it to take it out.If we had bought this machine from a brick and mortar store, it would be going back. Since it was less than $80 delivered, and the coffee is as good as any other drip machine -- and I like to be able to make one cup at a time from my own grind, we'll keep it."
"I ordered a refurbished Capresso and when it arrived it looked like new. However, the on and off switch doesn't work.  It has to be unplugged to turn it off.  What do I do?  Please advise! Thank you!fortneygirl"
I consider myself very unlucky with coffee machines!! I go through them like nothing else. Delongghi. Crips. French presses. Italian presses. Drip. Pump.... You get my point.Until I got this beauty.
"This is the second Capresso Cappuccino machine that we have purchased (this one was a Christmas gift for our daughter and son in law) and it was a home run. Does everything the manufacturer promised with ease. In the grand scheme of things, it will pay for itself cutting down on trips to Starbucks and the like. I was pleased with the whole Amazon experience from start to finish and being new to online shopping will be doing this type of shopping more in the future."
Great espresso and crema. Could be better at making foam. The frother doesn't get the foam as dense as I like. Great for entry level hobbyists.
"I am a first time espresso machine buyer and I researched for a while on the best budget machines. This machine blows my mind. It produces great crema and espresso. It is a little loud, especially when steaming/frothing milk (like a jet is taking off) but it does the job and so the noise doesn't bother me.Small machine though and a coffee cup won't fit where the espresso comes out of the machine. A mug however, will fit under the milk frothed. It has a decent sized water container in the back so you don't have to fill it at each use and a cup warmer on top."
"My husband purchased this for me for Christmas. I received it on the 25th and it worked with mediocre results until the morning of the 27th. Even with the preheating ritual that the manual recommends, the drink comes out warm at best. The milk frother was the first thing to go. Barely any steam despite all recommended trouble shooting. Cheap, cheap, cheap."
"The machine brews far too quickly, resulting in an espresso that is not really espresso, but just a cup of coffee.  It only takes about six to seven seconds to brew, when the time should be more like 25-30 seconds.  My old, cheap Krups brewed a better espresso, and even my individual plastic holder for a cone filter brews a more robust cup of coffee.  Note, that I have not changed the brand of coffee in making these comparisons, and use a dark espresso roast and good beans.  Actually tried an even finer grind to see if it would create a brew that was more like espresso, but that did not work either,.  It does make a good crema, and great foamed milk.  But the coffee is just yucky......  I had hoped that changing the grind size, etc. would make a difference, and so tried a lot of different things.  The coffee is not very hot when it comes out, and I ended up using the microwave to heat up water in the cup prior to brewing so that the coffee would be hot.  Finally, after all these experiments, I decided to try to return it.  (Generally I never return things -- just figure out how to make them work.)  Unfortunately, now I have waited too long to return it and it can neither be returned nor replaced by Amazon.  Wish I had just returned it right away rather than trying to get it make a good cup of espresso.  Not happy at all...."
"I don't often write reviews, but I had to come back for this one. I couldn't be happier with this machine. I've had it now for almost a year and it works like it did on day 1. I make a latte a day, but it easily makes more, heats up fast, frother is awesome with a little practice, and super easy to clean. I was recently staying with a friend who had one of those $500 machines that does everything for you and my drinks tasted aweful, the frother barely worked, and it took longer than this one does. I couldn't wait to get back home to my machine. My mother-in-law was recently visiting from out of town who just drinks regular coffee from a coffee maker and called after going back home to say that she was missing the espressos! I've never had another one, but I have to say that I'm in love with it and would buy it again 5 more times!"
"I purchased this machine based on a recommendation of a close friend. He's made me coffee from his, while visiting his home. It heats up fast, and makes a good coffee. It's a small machine, basic, no frills, etc. However, it serves its purpose quite well. As I said, it heats up fast and takes up little counter space. I actually use this at my office.I had issues with the first machine I purchased. After about a month of usage, 2-3 coffees a day, the steam wand stopped working. While in steam mode, the machine didn't make any noise or produce steam. Almost as if the switch wasn't triggering. However, coffee was still producible.I contacted Capresso directly, without expecting much in the way of customer service. Much to my surprise, they apologized for the machine malfunction. The shipped me out a brand new machine, that day, without hesitation! Once I received the new machine, I un-boxed and ensured it worked. Then I boxed up the malfunctioning unit (in the same box I received the new one), affixed the prepaid UPS label (that they provided!!) and shipped it back to Capresso. Really was a fantastic customer service experience. I thought for sure that I would have issues.At any rate, I'm using a brand new machine for the past week and am extremely happy. I brew ESE pods at work through the machine and it's 'single cup' porta filter basket. I steam milk via the steam wand, occasionally using the frothier."
"She was my birthday present I bought with a gift card. I love her uniqueness and how she has a touch of Frankenstein in her. At 44, it's hard to find something odd and fun."
Love these dolls!  They each have their own personality and story.  They are sturdy and fun to play with (all ages) and best of all?  They are MODEST!
<3  Lala dolls. My girls are totally gaga over all the dolls.I have yet to purchase one my girls did not like
My daughter just got this doll for her birthday. She is beautiful and colorful and my child loves her and just in time for Halloween. I'm also very satisfied with the quick delivery.
My daughter waited over a year to get a mini Scraps. We searched for her online and in stores but just couldn't find her. When I saw that they had made a large doll of her I ordered one right away. She is so adorable...especially for someone with blueish skin. She's a fantastic additon to any Lalaloopsy collection now only because she's awesome but also because with her black hair with the white and her blueish skin she is very unique. All in all a fantastic doll :D #lalaloopsyinsiders
Loved it. Came on time and was a perfect gift for myself.
"my little sister loved this doll, it was in great shape ,this dolls last a long time,the package was in good shape as well"
"Beautiful doll, my daughter loves it."
"I ordered this for my daughter's 5th birthday, and she absolutely loves it! This one is my favorite so far. It got here when expected, was packed where it would not get damaged, and got it at a great price! Would definitely recommend!"
This is so far the only lalaloopsy Halloween exclusive that has been made into a regular size doll so we had to get her! My daughter absolutely loves her!
MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS DOLL
Another Lalaloopsy doll I purchased for my granddaughter!  She's absolutely a very unique doll and I love that about all of the Lalaloopsy doll collection.  Great purchase..Linda L.
"This was very cute. It was a gift for my granddaughter who loved it! It wasn't what I wanted, because I was looking for a ragdoll type of lalaloopsy character."
"I've bought two dolls to my niece, a monster high and a lalaloopsy, she just went crazy with the last one. The doll is somehow bigger than I thougt. If your taking it in a travel bag take some time and see the product dimensions."
"It was a gift for my grand daughter, she loved it - I would recommended it for any little girl"
"this doll is well built, my daughter normally doesn't play with dolls, but for some reason this doll gets played with more than any other doll I bought her. I guess maybe because it has an exotic look to it.."
"my daughter collects these girls, so its always here on amazon for the best prices.......love itand the good part is if you cant find the unique ones in the store look here 1st!!!"
"Bought this for my Granddaughter.  Well made, cute doll.  My Granddaughter really liked it.  I was real pleased with how lively the doll was."
"Oh, this is our first lalaloopsyvand she is adorable!!! I was afraid my daughter wouldn't love her as much (she's really girly) but she does!  I see many more of these dolls in our future!"
Love this doll. I like to collect offbeat dolls and this looks great in my collection. Great quality doll. Heavier than I had expected. Shipping thru Amazon was quick as always thanks to using Amazon Prime.
My daughter received this as a Christmas present and it is one of her favorite toys. It's durable and cute and she loves making softie up with her
I got this doll for my daughter for Christmas and she loved it! Was a huge hit. Well made and Amazon had the best price on her. Very happy.
Very happy with the fast delivery.
This a great doll at a great prices. It's well made and my wife loves it. It's just as described.
Way cuter in person but her dress ripped within the first week of having her. I guess that gives me an excuse to make her some new clothes... Now shopping for a friend for Scraps and of course my daughter. The great thing about this doll was the price - I paid $14.99 for her on amazon vs 29.99 in department stores.
"I looked EVERYWHERE for this doll for my granddaughter! Thank you so much, she was delighted on Christmas! You guys are the best!!!!!!"
"it was as expected, i like it the product. it was on time for christmas. I am please with it."
"I have been wanting Scraps Stitched N Sewn since she was a limited Mini, so I was super happy when she came out as a regular Lalaloopsy.I bought her as soon as Christmas was over, just in case someone had purchased her for me, and she just came in. I'm very happy with her.She is the same nice quality of the other Lalaloopsy dolls, her outfit is really nice and made with good quality materials. She is a little taller than my first generation Lalaloopsy, and (luckily) her legs don't swing as much as the older ones.  It's not like she can stand on her own anyway, but I always put mine in metal stands, and having sturdier legs helps to keep her upright, especially with such a big head.I would be careful with her around smaller children, there aren't many small parts, but her head is pretty hard and heavy, so it could be dangerous if thrown around."
"Believe it or not, my 14 year old daughter still collects these dolls and this was on her to-buy list for awhile!  I'm so happy I found it on Amazon!  They had over 15 of them in stock at my local ToysRUs for $10 more than what I paid here.  She is much more amazing in person!"
"Cute doll. The little girls seems to love them, and two of our granddaughters (cousins) requested this one especially. They were happy to receive them this Christmas."
"For any collector of LaLa loopsie you know that pictures are not always the 'best' way to determine the best dolls. This one is MUCH cuter in person than her pictures. I had bought her to 're-sell' and once I saw her in person, it was love at first sight. She is one of the more detailed and charming of the dolls in my opinion and probably one of the more unique dolls to collect for the starting out collector"
"Just in time for Halloween, this adorable new Lalaloopsy doll reminded us of a lady Frankenstein. Her outfit is so cute and we love the white stripe in her hair. This is the best Lala doll on our shelf, (and we have collected about 14 of them so far. I'm also really impressed with how sturdy these dolls are. Really well made. You get a lot for the money."
"Not aware they were both exactly the same, why would I want two packages that were identical?"
My daughter was thrilled!
I cannot stand these things!!!  But I still buy them.  I am now getting the same things in every order but my kids love them so I need to stop complaining.  My daughter says boys sometimes collect but mostly girls.  It's exciting to see how rare the secret shopkins is in the cart below.
very pleased
It was delivered great
My daughter loved it!
Recipient loved adding this to her collection of toys
cute
"My 7 & 4 yr olds are obsessed with Shopkins right now and the 4 yr old wouldn't stop talking about Lippy Lips. Once I discerned what she was saying, I had to make her dreams come true. The things we do for our kids.... anyway, she loved it and held it in her hand for about 3 days straight. As with all Shopkins, we have no idea where it is now. Oh well."
My niece couldn't put it down all Christmas day.
"So cute!  I have been on the lookout for a Lalaloopsy doll for quite some time.  I spotted this one just beforeChristmas and instantly decided ""that's the one!"".  I got it and am so happy.  She is absolutely adorable, andwill be a hard one to top, I am sure.  My little girl is going to flip for it."
My 6 yr old loved it! !
The 5 year old that got this doll for Christmas was very happy in deed!!
pretty doll!
"My daughter loves her.  I personally think she's weird looking, but it wasn't for me.  This doll has an abnormally large head and will not sit on her own.  We donated this doll to a charity that gives toys to kids in our local hospital.  My daughter has the birthday one."
Fantastic and fast shipping!!
my daughter loves her dolls but OMG are the head's heavy.  I hope to never get hit with one of these things flying across the room.. they'll put an eye out.but she loves them all the same... like a good mommy should :)
"I'M 13 AND MY GRANDMA GOT THIS FOR ME FOR CHRISTMAS. THIS DOLL IS SO PRETTY! HER HAIR IS IMMENSELY AWESOME! HER DRESS IS VERY FANCY, BUT IT'S POOR QUALITY. THEY DID NOT HEM THE BOTTOM OF THE DRESS AND IT IS RAPIDLY UNRAVELING,. THE DOLL'S BUTTERFLY IS SO CUTE AND IT HAS LEAVES FOR WINGS. HER SHOES ARE ADORABLE.HERE ARE SOME PHOTOS"
I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter and both she and I were very pleased with it.

My daughter  loves her Loopsy dolls no complaints
Teddy love it
My granddaughter loves this. She is 7.
"This is the fourth and final doll in this collection that I purchased for my 3 year old grand daughter. She absolutely loved them. This one sure was hard to come by, but to finish the collection and see her smile and play with them all....worth the wait."
My 7 year old's favorite game. Just the perfect level for them.
This arrived exactly as described and within the specified delivery time.  It made a fabulous Christmas present for my daughter and I would definitely order from seller again.
Very little thought was put into this game. I only gave it two stars because my son liked it the first two times we played...
Perfect.  It is for an upcoming birthday gift.  I think he will love it!
So cute! The extra outfit and changing hair color made it a hit!
Reasonable pricing and I totally freaked out when comparing the exact same product with the price at Toys R Us.Speedy delivery thanks to Amazon Prime. Product came in as expected and we enjoyed the game.
"My niece loved this doll, I would recommend this for any lalaloopsy lover."
"Ordered as gift. Delivered to them, not me."
So cute....My Granddaughters love these dolls. They are bigger than they look and are very detailed.
4 year old daughter looooved it.  plays it for hours.  very cute.  simple for the younger ones.
"I gave this to my 6yo daughter for Christmas. She loves Lalaloopsy and has really enjoyed playing this game. It took a bit of time for her to figure it out, but now that she has, she plays it often."
"This is such a cute game. My 5 year old loves it, it's not too hard but it also gives her a little challenge. Such a wonderful game for any Lalaloopsy lover."
My 4year old loves the game!
Received as expected in a timely fashion.
Good
"PERFECT  ITEM, Fast arrivery time, , will be buying again from  this seller, thank you."
perfect condition thank you!
great price and fast shipping!
My granddaughter just loved it & I was very impressed!
I bought this and another Lalaloopsy doll for my little cousins and they flipped out over them.  They are good quality for the money too; definitely a good buy for little girls.
My granddaughter loved this doll.
Easy to lose the little butterfly - would be nice if the doll could hold the butterfly.
Exactly as advertised
Great...i love it
Cute addition to the collection
nice
"My granddaughter loved it!!!  Great price, great delivery!!!"
Now we need to get the rest of the minion tokens!
the littlies liked it..
"This is a great set. It includes two exclusive Shopkins, Hot Apple Pie and Rolly Roll, as well as a bag for each. There is also a bread basket swing that can hold two Shopkins, and a mixer that you can place a Shopkin on and spin it around. The pink trays are detachable, and the clear display window opens up so you can put some Shopkins inside. This set can connect to the Easy Squeezy Fruit & Veg Stand, but that set must be purchased separately. The Small Mart does not connect to it, but looks great by it. This is the perfect set for any Shopkins collector!"
Collects them
Grandson loves these.
Great. Daughter loves it.
Granddaughter is going to love this for her bday.
This is cute.  I like that it doesn't have a million little pieces but offers a fun play session.  My daughter loves all things Shopkins and this has just added to her collection.
I've received no complaints from my Grandaughter.
Meets my expectations
My granddaughter really enjoys this game.
Fun! My six year old niece loves it!
My daughter loves this game and so far it's one of her favorites.
a+++
My 5-year-old really seems to enjoy this game.  She can play most of it on her own with an occasional bit of assistance.
My daughter is a fan of the TV show so she just loves this game.
very good
great to have for the girls at slummer party.
The delivery is really fast it came in 3 days. I got this lalaloopsy game for my six year old daughter and she loves it and it was a good price.
"It's pretty boring, but kind of fun at the same time."
My daughter loves it. Ez to clean. Would buy another one for her collection.
My daughter loves this doll and it's nice to see her playing with it.I would recommend it to any parent for their girls.
Adorable doll.
OK
My baby was so so happy when she receives 2 Lala dolls today. She loves the color and everything. Thanks Amazon for speedy delivery. It's 1 week ahead of estimated delivery schedule.
Love it
"she is cuter than expected... my little one LOVES playing with these, and I saw this and could not resist.. she is ADORABLE!"
got this dirt cheap on cyber monday.  can't beat a ten dollar lalaloopsy!
So beautiful!
I don't get it but my daughter loves these.  She plays with them almost every day.
Nice addition to the Shopkins lineup of toys.
"Well, my 6 year old niece absolutely adores it!"
The kids love it. They play with it all the time.
As expected!!  My grandaughter loved this.
My daughter loves this toy.
This game was missing one of the properties. Had to return.
Very good
Always love a classic!
FUN GAME !!!!
Great
Great family game.
"Very often when I see a new Lalaloopsy doll I fall instantly in love with it. Sometimes when I bring it home and compare it with my other Lalaloopsy dolls I find that I prefer some over others. However, that was not the case for Rosebud whatsoever- despite having over 30 dolls in my collection, some of which are the most rare and hard-to-find, like Cloud E. and Cinder Slippers, Rosebud has quickly become my most favourite Lalaloopsy doll to date. I don't think that pictures of her do her justice whatsoever- she is absolutely gorgeous in real life and I highly recommend her to ANYONE and EVERYONE interested in this dolls."
"Received the doll yesterday. She is adorable! She will be a great addition to our Lalaloopsy collection. My daughter loves her pink dress and the butterfly (one of her favorite pets).I have received this product from MGAE as part of their toy tester program, but my opinions are my own."
my daughter loves this doll! Super cute. Great price.
"Beautifull doll, excelent services"
Very lovely doll.  My daughter's favorite.
Great classic game and received it right on time. We're still playing it since my purchase for Christmas 2014!!!!
Very nice
good item
Great game! Hours of fun! Love the cat addition.
"Thought it will be the original one from 1996, but only then realized that it would not cost so litle. As for a price its ok, you cannot expect any better."
Favorite Game of All TIME! This provides the classic Monopoly game everyone loves. Was delivered in tack and on time.
"It's still a pretty good game, but I was looking for the game where Israel always wins because it controls the federal reserve, the central banks, and the IMF... all the while bankrupting it allies...THAT'S A MONOPOLY, RIGHT?"
Excellent
Our oldest child just turned 7 and she's really into board games so we bought this to start having a family game night.  This is a great game for the family.  The reason I gave it 4 stars was because the board doesn't fold in half like board games use to.  Instead it folds into quaters and that makes it seem flimsy and one part of the board actually doesn't lay down flat when we play.
good
Different/older spin on lalaloopsy. My tween likes it.
"This was too cute, and discovered her braids change color.  Granddaughters loved it."
"Bought as Christmas gift. Shipped super fast, packaging was terrific! Good, new product & was described well"
AS EXPECTED
Very cute!!
Very cute. My girl loves it so I guess I do too! Satisfied customer!
Fantastic thanks!
Such a cute little doll thanks so much my daughter enjoys the fact that her new lala can fit in her back pack and she can take it to school!
Why did you say add hair day new'v cave nerves we've got a cocoa ready for just about everything it sep for one missing a roommate
Lalaloopsy dolls are my daughter's favorites.  The girls are just as  great as all of the other ones she has.  Never disappointed.
My granddaughter loved it - I was very popular this Christmas!
"This classic Monopoly game is exactly what our family wanted. My son loves it. I personally have always kind of hated Monopoly. I just don't like games that take longer to play than Peter Jackson's Tolkien trilogy. But that's a personal bend, not something against this set."
This was a birthday gift that my daughter treasures. She fits well in a Barbie Dream house.
"This was a real hit with my granddaughter. A ""must have"" if you are into Shopkins."
Very cute toy!! My 4yr old loves it!
"I have been looking all over for the playset season 1 and every store are sold out. I should of bought them during Christmas cause there were a little cheaper but I am just glad I found them. I am very pleased and so as my kids they just LOVE collecting them, it's very addicting I must say!! This is very sturdy and good quality made especially comes with two shopkins figures which my kids are pleased with."
"If you have a few people ready to play a little competitively, get this!  If you need to replace your old copy, get a fresh one."
5 and 10 Year old daughters received for Christmas and love to play with it!
my little girl enjoys it so much!  :)
"I have 2 girls, 4 and 5 yrs old. They are loving this game... it is perfect for them."
4 1/2 year-old daughter is a HUGE Lalaloopsy fan and this game is perfect for her! She really enjoys playing it. The graphics are cute.
My daughter who is 6 can play this with not help.  Kept her attention for over 20 minutes. Good for little girls.
i got this for my 3 yr old daughter for christmas. it's now may and she still plays it about every day.
BUENO..!
WAS PURCASHED FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN FOR THEIR BIRTHDAY AND THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE ITEM YET.  I AM SURE THEY WILL LIKE IT
"Got it for my niece. She loves it! Thought it would entail a little more game wise, but for the age it's good."
"My three girls ages 2-8 really like this game. It's a little challenging for the youngest one, but even she can enjoy this. Great game."
"My 8 year old niece has a Nintendo 3ds game and is always looking for new games. She actually wanted a Lalaloopsy DOLL and new 3DS games then I saw this game, how could I go wrong...she was playing it when I called her on Christmas Day."
This is a great age appropriate 3ds game.  My granddaughters love it.  I would definitely recommend it for your collection of 3ds games.
CHILD LIKED IT.  FUN ITEMS INCLUDED THAT GO WELL WITH OTHER SHOPKINS SETS.  WELL MADE ENOUGH SO IT SHOULD LAST FOR A WHILE.  I AM PLEASED.
My god daughter collects them she love it thank you it was a gift for her
Granddaughter loved it.
she collects them just loves it
cute
My 7 year old daughter was so excited by this toy and just loves it!!
Granddaughter loved it.  Seems well made.
Kids love it.
"I only like these because my 7 year old likes them so much.  Many small, rubber parts so not good for families with small children (or pets)."
"I usually don't like games that were adopted from originals to be something they weren't originally supposed to be. They are usually made quickly, without much thought, and are meant to cash in on the hype but this one was a very pleasant surprise. It's unique, fun even for adults, and very well thought through and designed. The spinning minion instead of a die isn't my favorite since the minion keeps falling off the spinning thing but other than that it's very cute and colorful. If your child is into minions he/she will love it."
returning-duplicate
It was ok
"This is basically a quick version of regular Monopoly.  There's about half the number of properties, no railroads and the house/hotel situation is dramatically simplified.  A 'long' game takes 30 minutes.  Normal play time is 20-30 minutes.  The spinning thing is kind of dumb so we usually use a single dice."
"This is a really cute game.  My son loves being able to play Monopoly with the family & this is perfect because it's an easier version that includes his favorite movie scenes.  The board with the scenes isn't too sturdy, so I hope it doesn't fall apart from our frequent use."
Anyone that loves the minions and monopoly HAS to order this! I gave it as a gift and my friends loved it.
"Great game for kids. Unlike traditional game. When the first person goes out, the game is over."
Fun for Family Game Night!
"Its perfect for any monopoly lover! My step son is obsessed with Monopoly, so it has become somewhat of an passion to collect all different themed monopoly board games. This was perfect - as he is also obsessed with Minions. Game play is interesting and the board pieces are definitely awesome to choose from and play with. Youll have an awesome time playing with kids!"
:)
"Son's girlfriend collects Monopoly games, so this was purchased for part of her collection!"
"Received in awesome timing, though I could have done without the box being free floating instead of packed in. We bought a couple games with this one and all of the games were simply tossed into the box with no packing materials. Other than that I'm happy with the time it took to come in which was earlier than expected."
Bought this for my 5 year old daughter. She is loving the game and loves Lalaloopsy. Keeps her entertained for hours during long drives.
My daughter played the game for about two days. Beat it and it wasn't very challenging for an 8 year old..
I think this is a cute and fun game.  I bought it for my daughter and she seems to like it.  I don't think she is CRAZY about it....so I just awarded it 4 stars.
Good game for a younger girl.  My 5 year old seems to enjoy it.  Very simple & basic game play. Older kids might think it is too simplistic.
"This game was bought as a gift for my six year old grand daughter, and she loves it. There are many fun adventures for her to take part in, and it was well worth the money."
daughter enjoys playing this 3ds card game very much. she loves playing together with other friends by connecting the 3ds to theirs so they play together.
The doll is cute.  The hate doesn't fit on my doll very well.  Seller is good and item was as described.
its a very value
A+
"My daughter loves this doll. In fact, she has already purchased two more of her ""BFFs""."
Was a Christmas gift and was loved by the seven year old who received it. Very cute
was a gift but the little girl loved it
"I wish all of her hair changed colors, but only a few strands changes. Her feet are also extremely fat compared to her legs, making putting her pants very difficult. Otherwise, she's very cute."
About the size of a barbie doll.  Very cute.  Was very happy with it.
I should clarify; my 9 year old nephew loves it. This version of the classic game is easier for use to play as the dollar amounts have been simplified. I appreciate that we can get through a game in about 30 minutes as opposed to our normal 3 hour Monopoly games.
Great game. Got for son for Christmas he collects these games. He had it already so I gave it to nephew he has four small kids. They love playing it.
I bought as a gift and my friend loved it!
"Minions! Love em. This is more as a collectible with me, but I do love it."
My Great Nephew wanted this for Christmas.  The whole family loves it
Like
good purchase
You need the box to play
Fun game with a twist. My daughter loved it (big minion fan!!!)
"This is one of the better Monopoly products. The minion figure tokens make the deal much better. We had the Cars version when my son was a cars fan, and this outdid that one."
"This is one of the CUTEST Lalaloopsy Big Dolls in my collection and I have the ALL! I adore these dolls and with each new series they are improving in not only quality but in detail and CREATIVITY. This pink petal is picture perfect from her petal dress to her rosebud hair I can not say enough how beautiful she is. Her pet is extremely original as well. Love the dress, hair, colors, pet and well most importantly my daughter loves her too! Lalalover for life!""I have received this product from MGAE as part of their toy tester program."""
"Very adorable! Love the hair & outfit & pet! Anyone who loves to get flowers, or roses in particular, would absolutely love this doll!! These dolls are all so cute & we love them!!! (I have received this product from MGAE as part of their toy tester program.)"
Rosebud is one of our favorite Lala characters. We fell in love with her when she was released as a mini and were so excited when she was released as a full size doll. She is a beautiful doll! We especially love the detailing of her hair and the sparkle of her dress.
LALA love her! Skirt is so sparkly and pretty. Loved adding her to our large collection.I have received this product from MGAE as part of their toy tester program
My daughter received this and another LaLaLoopsy doll and we could not be happier.  They are adorable and right in line with the Lalaloopsy line.  We especially loved the color changing hair on this doll as it adds a little bit of pizazz.  Great Christmas/Birthday gift idea for the little LalaLoopsy Fan! I have received this product from MGAE as part of their toy tester program.
i received this toy in exchange for my review however my opinions are my own~ i have been collecting the mini lalaoopsy's for a couple years now. i do own a few large dolls as well! i think its terrific they have come out with the lalaoopsy girls dolls! they are so cute and have adorable clothes! my grand daughters love them all!
I have received this doll in exchange for this review however the opinions are my own.  I think this is a cute doll. My granddaughters love them. They ask for the dolls all the time. I think every little girl should have some.
"I received this toy in exchange for my review, however my opinions are my ownThis is a great doll. My daughter loves playing with her and enjoys that she has a change of clothes to pjs. I hope to buy more and that they may release some other clothes too. To change her hair color is very easy.. We are very happy in this house to have her for sure.. I highly recommend this doll to anyone.."
"We were blessed to receive this doll in the mail from MGA this afternoon.  When I saw an email promising a free doll through the mail, I never actually expected it to show up!  But the truck pulled up this afternoon and now my daughter has her very own Lalaloopsy Girl!I received this toy in exchange for my review, however my opinions are my own.This is a great doll!  My daughter loves her hair!  She has already taken it down from the braids it came with and is working on braiding it again.  She loves that the doll can stand up on it's own.  She loves how easy it is to change the color of the hair.  To change from blue to purple, all you need is ice water.  To change back, all you need is the warmth of your hand.  Much easier than going back and forth from cold to hot water!  It's great to have extra clothes for the doll too!  My daughter is love the pajamas for her doll !Thanks to MGA for this great doll!  Looking forward to purchasing more great Lalaloopsy merchandise in the future!"
"I was so excited to see yet another line added to Lalaloopsy.  This little girls are so much fun to dress and re-do their hair all rolled into one doll that isn't a Barbie!  They even have their own little pets, too!!  You have an option to buy a doll with an extra outfit or a single doll without an extra outfit which saves on your wallet if it is a little light that week.  So, much fun!  I would highly recommend this doll to family and friends for their little ones.  Love, love, love!!  Hopefully we will see some separate fashions!!"
Mittens is super cute as a Lala Girl and I love her outfit and styling! These girls are absolutely adorable!
"We love lalaloopsy girls already and mittens is sew cute!  I don't understand the nubs with socks on instead of feet but the shoes are cute enough and I like that they can stand up with shoes on unlike the regular lala dolls! Also love that mittensn, bea, jewel, and pixie all come with pjs anf barrettes! I really wish all the others came with pjs too!"
as good as always
Item was ordered and shipped. No problem.
A classic was and will always be.
It's monopoly and it was a good price.  Can take a while to play.  Relationships may suffer and feelings may be hurt.
Box was smashed & u need the box 2 play the game
great condition happy with it
great game. simple instructions.
This set is much better than the one I had growing up. The bank tray is very convenient.
"My Grandson, was happy to get this game. :)"
Five stars!
Cute game for kids.  Not as intense and time consuming as the full version of monopoly.  Cute features and good family fun.
We received this item super fast. This was for a christmas present.  It is my neices favorite gift or so I like to think.
it is a great game for the kids to play my youngest daughter really likes dora so she was excited to play this
"My daughter has not stopped playing this game since she opened it. Very cute, entertaining and lots of fun for kids of any ages."
"Delivery time was good, just pkg was crushed & it was for Christmas outer appearance looked bad"
My daughter absolutely loves this!
My granddaughter loves this and all Shopkins toys. She has several now and likes this one quite a bit.Toy Crazes replaced the original damaged shipment without my asking. Thanks!!
"My 4 year old granddaughter who is ""crazy for Shopkins""  (her words) loves it."
"My daughter said ""it is really awesome"". I recommend the bakery play set to every little person, who love Shopkins"
Daughter loves Shopkins so this is  great addition to her collection.
small parts older child
Really fast shipping! Exactly as described! Thanks!!
As described.  Arrived on date promised.
xmas gift
This game is so much fun for my 6 yo. She just got a 3ds for her birthday and she loves it. The first game we bought was hotel tranalvania an she liked it but i think it was a bit advanced. The lalaloopsy game though she will play for hours and considering she is a fan of the dolls an has alot of them it really brings it to life for he.
"My niece loves Lalaloopsy this year, so when I found this game for her new DS this Christmas she was thrilled. It arrived quickly and she has already played it a hundred times!!! LOL"
i dislike because this is not available to my daughter's Nitendo 3DS ( it is European style and the game disk is available only for US Nitendo 3DS)
just what she wants
"Christmas gift, Looks well put together and I am sure she will love it"
Cute as always.  Just trying to complete my daughter's collection!
"Love this set!!! Arrive when stated, great condition and granddaughter is soooo happy with it.  Thank you!"
Awesome! My granddaughter loves it!
"Poor quality, cheap edition that arrived without all the pieces. Spend a couple of dollars more and buy a vintage set. It's worth the money."
Grandson loved it!!
Awesome. Thanks!!!
My son loves it.
cuteeeeee!!
"cheap quality, get what you pay for"
This is an awesome game for the kids and family esspecially a family that loves minions
These are freaking adorable. My daughter just had a birthday over the weekend and my father gifted these to her. I like how they have limited edition and ultra rare figures. It makes the hunt for them even more fun.
"My grandchildren loved it"""
Grand daughter loved it.
Granddaughter likes it! Thanks!
I really like playing with it
Hate this version it is so cheaply made I hated everything about it
"My daughter loves Lalaloopsy Dolls so she was really excited to get a couple of the new Lalaloopsy Girls to play with. She likes that these toys look a little older. These dolls are fun because several of them in the series have hair that will change color in the freezer or ice water. We like to stick Mittens Fluff n Stuff doll in the freezer for about 10 minutes and then my daughter is able to enough her purple striped hair. This doll comes with a change of outfits, a comb and a pet! On the packaging is a big white bow for your daughter to wear in her own hair. It is such a cute toy and comes recommended by my 8 year old!I received this toy in exchange for my review, however my opinions are my own."
"I think Mittens is a super cool girl because she can do many adorable things in life!I really like it when she stands,its like she is a real girl that is such a famous and popular. I got to go byyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Love that you can actually dress these new lalaloopsy girl dolls up. And my daughter loves that about them too its like her two favorite things combine lalaloopsy and barbie!
Mittens is my fav  she can do yoga and have snow days that's fun a lot. And she has a little sister name bundle but most importantly....SHE'S GOING TO HIGH SCHOOL YAY everybody knows that I love her PJ's and pet now I love her I'm going to get her for Christmas ok now BYE!????
"Mittens Fluff N Stuff is one the my favorite Lalaloopsy dolls! When I saw that she was part of the Lalaloopsy Girls line, I HAD to have her! She's absolutely adorable. I really like the way MGA designed these dolls. She has the regular black button eyes and th  pink cheeks, just like the regular Lalaloopsy dolls. Her hair is plastic strands that you can braid or put in cute buns on the side of her head. She comes with a cute fuzzy hat and a cute outfit that she's wearing. That's not all, she comes with pajamas and her polar bear. There's  Macomb included to comb through her hair, an  her boots with pink leg warmers help her stand up on her own. That's the best part. She stands on her own, unlike the Large Dolls. Also, the handle is a hair clip! You can use it for yourself! And there's hair clips shaped like snowflakes for the doll. The doll displays well in her box, but you can display her without it, just as well. I highly recommend this line of dolls!"
"Mittens Fluff n Stuff is so adorable with her blue straw like hair that turns purple when wet. And goes back to blue when it dries.  She comes with an adorable bear, and pajamas that match. She has the cutest pink legwarmer boots, along with a blue coat shirt, that white faux fur on the sleeves, neck line and along the bottom.  And a built in pink turtle neck look.  Her white faux fur hat  with bear ears is very cute. And when not wearing her hat, you can put the big white plastic bow in her hair.This dolls face has a almost rag doll look.  Love her black button look eyes.My daughter and her friend have so much fun playing with these dolls and their pets."
"Adorable doll with color changing hair, pet and an extra outfit. Cute, very happy."
"Had high hopes for the Lalaloopsy Girls series, and so far has not disappointed. The storyline is cute, and the dolls themselves are perfect for my 8 year old."
Love love love! Perfect packaging and perfect product for my kids and family :)
Shipped in great condition!  My family loves playing it!
Good
Classic.
My grandkids will like this I hope - I know most kids did while they were growing up.
"We play as a family, ages 8 and up. The game piece looks like our Schnauzer and the kids love it!"
classic all the way
A classic and always fun to play on a rainy day
"Perfect board game! Monopoly is a classic and thats why I purchase the original monopoly (well close to original, it does have the cat) My friends and I have had a lot of fun playing this game and being annoyed over jail!  I just wish the box had better storage for everything, to keep it organized and together."
Family gaming has made a return
My 8 year old daughter is a Minion fan so this game met her expectations and was her favorite Christmas gift.  Good delivery time.
Grand Daughter loved it.
thank you
Fun and easy to play with kids! 3D board play adds to the excitement as you move around trying to create a monopoly of property ownership. Cute cupcakes and sundaes act as markers for what you own while Minions scurry around the board. The spinner takes some finesse and was difficult for the younger kids. We easily replaced it with a die and the fun continued. Great family enjoyment!
Adorable and great for my young grandsons
We had great fun with this during the holiday.
"Very disappointed and very misleading...I thought this was the regular version of monopoly just in a 'minion' theme, it is NOT!!! This is like a monopoly junior for children!!!"
great!
"I bought this as a gift for my firlfriends's son and he loves it,he loves Monopoly, this fun twist on the game made it possible for younger players!"
"When my daughter was doll-age, her choices were pretty much Barbies or Brats. These give a non-sexy, fun and funky alternate that I love. Let's let girls be girls, not sexy and flirty, right?Believe me as the mom of a teenage girl, there is PLENTY of time for that later. Mittens Fluff 'n StuffTM?  Yep. Made from an Eskimo's scarf, has a pet polar bear. This deluxe set includes Mittens Fluff 'N' Stuff fashion doll with color-changing braids, extra pajama outfit, adorable pet polar bear, 2 hair clips and comb for doll, and hair clip for girl. So stinking cute!Now my teen daughter are a bit too these adorable dolls, but we know so many girls that would adore them.My full review is here: http://www.unitedstatesofmotherhood.com/2014/10/lalaloopsy-girls-stitched.htmlDisclosure: I was given a doll to review on my blog"
Grandchildren and I enjoy playing this game.A lot of fun! The quality of game construction could be better. The minion that fits on the spinner after playing two games  now will not stay attached to spinner. Game board set up not stable very easy to knock all playing pieces off very annoying.Yet we still enjoy the game.
This is pretty cute. There's not much to it--it's just a doll--but the hair is pretty neat. It does change color in cold water. My daughter loves it and wants to get more of these. They're kind of like Barbie-sized Lalaloopsies.
Everyone loves Monopoly!
"Do you like game's with action? Do you like game's you can ern money? Do you like ganme's with characte? If you say yes to all the qeshdes. Then...You should play Mnoply!Mnoply is a game you play with family.  The goal is to have the most money. 6 peopel can play. It is relly fun. My epnyen is you should play mnoply.The best part is when you are able to own bordwock and park plass if you own both if some one lands an your propd they ow you 10 dolers. The whas part is if you run out of mony the game is over and you loss.In my opinion you should defninitely play mnoply. You get to pick your charter the chrter I allwas pick is the dog. The cgrter's you have in opshin is a cat, dog, car, bowt. I have played mnoply before. have you played beffor. If you like game that have chrter, you can ern mony, then you will like mnoply, mnoply is a game you play with fmilye,One reason you should play mnoply is you play it with famly. and it talk about good thing about your chrters. Also you can own the swiming pollAnother reason is if you won a block is dubls in priss. You should play mnoly because it is fun and you ern mony. And you get to pick your chrther. In my opiyun you should defly deffly defly play...Mnoply!!!it is fun and you ean mony you get to pick yor charter and the more plas you have the beter because you have more monyAgain you should play mnoply because it is a wundf game."
"On time, great price"
"Love these new Lalaloopsy girls line! They are so adorable and beautifully designed. Great for creative and fashion play for little girls, they are so sweet and must haves for any Lalaloopsy fan! Can't wait to get these <3"
"I'm just really creeped out by this new Lalaloopsy range. The whole appeal of lalaloopsy was to promote cute, age-appropriate, pretty, wholesome 'rag doll' type dolls. There are even some 'edgy' dolls (like Scraps) for people that don't do 'cutesy'. Why MGA decided to morph these dolls into skinny, bobbleheaded.thigh-gapped sad imitations of ugly barbies is beyond me. Won'y be allowing in my house. Love original lalaloopsy though."
My daughter loves them!!
My daughter said she liked it but thought she should have gotten more for her money.
So I bought these shopkins for my nephew who told me about them and I know they'll be super surprise for Easter with them. I actually think there all so neat looking and would not mind getting some for myself thank you so much.
My daughter loves them!!!
Took a little too long for my grandaughter to get it almost 3-weeksbut she likes them
My daughter's a happy camper
Great bunch of shopkins. Packaged perfectly.  We love them
Grwat product
Perfect
terrific
"O Boy this really rock the kids kingdom , they are so into this game it is beyond words .  once we got the hag of it , we just kept playing and playing , they didn't want to stop.  Fun for all."
This is a Great Item and seller is great. Fast shipping!1 Love it!!!  A+++
Kids loved it
Thanks!
"For kids only.  Not adults.  The board and features are well made, but this is just for kids/families."
"Such a fun game! My daughter got this as a gift and we play it often. Much more fun and quick than regular Monopoly. If you like Despicable Me, you'll get a kick out of this game!"
was a gift and they thought it was awesome
It's great
Provided my grandaughter with hours of play.
Great for the kids. They want to play because it's despicable me and it keeps them up on their math. They're 6 and 7. Cute.
Kids loved this game. Board is a little awkward but it's a fun version and goes way quicker then normal monopoly which is what we were going for.
It was fun to play but really cheaply made.
Great
So I'm happy.
"Having fun,very good game,all family likes."
"to say the recipient was "" thrilled"" is putting it mildly. the kids love these as an addition to the original kit"
"Great Game, and great quality! Perfect for a family game night and i'm more than satisfied with this purchase. I love that this one even includes the new cat."
variability of styles causes lots of drama. They wanted the mushroom.
"Monopoly games are so much fun and come in so many different types. I had to have the ""CAT"" piece and it was way cheaper to buy the adorable game, than to buy just the piece. I have a number of special monopoly games and love them all. Great buy, great price, always great fun."
They took a while to arrive but that was my fault for not paying attention to the expected delivery date. The toys are adorable and my daughter loves them.
"loved playing this as a kid, some new rules that I don't remember, but my 6 year old loved it."
She loved them and wants more
"Fast shipping. Great game, lose your friends or your house"
Obviously very fun! Do I need to really write anything? Monopoly is awesome.
Great game!
"My daughter LOVES it so much she'll die for it, and I mean BEG me for it!!!!"
Great game
"BE CAREFUL. You could order these all day long and always get the same ones due to the fine print that says ""contents may vary."" we bought this specific one because my daughter has been looking for a few particular ones shown in the pictures. However, when this package arrived, it had the exact same ones of all the other season 1 packs that we've tried to purchase."
Great classic game
Daughter love them
"Great pricing,fast shipping.Thanks!"
My daughter loves themCute but what a retail mark uo
My 9yr old loved them
Santa did well..daughter was pleased!!
Be ready for wait for it  but really nice shopkins my kids love it
Took awhile for shipping but happy once received.
I bought them for my 5 year old daughter. She loved them. Arrived in time and we were satisfied with the purchase.
Great
My grand daughter loves all Shopkins & this was no exception.
"Nice way to start a collection, my daughter does prefer the shopping baskets with the surprise bags inside. She loves opening them and finding the name of each toy."
Son loves
Son loves these
"Season 1 Shopkins are very cute, BUT the kids are really wanting season 2 so spend the extra money and buy them Season 2, they'll love you for it!!!"
"Important, ""styles will vary"". Kids were disappointed they didn't get the ones pictured. Did include the one they really wanted."
"We felt in love with the mininons since we saw the movie the first time, and we love monopoly so I cannot imagine better combo."
Love these  fast shipping and the package was perfect
It is easy to play and good for short leisure.Suitable for relative young school age kidsComic figures are attractive
My twins loved them!!
Kids love it. Super quick shipping.
"This is a fun game, but kind of hard to keep all the pieces together.  Wish it had better organization and maybe even a little simpler for kids, but overall it's very fun."
"When my daughter first showed an interest in Shopkins, I thought they were the most ridiculous toy I'd ever seen.  I have to say, I've changed my mind.  They are cute, can be used in play with many other toys and are small enough not to take up too much room in my house, but not so small that I am constantly sucking them up in the vacuum.  The only down side to them is that if your child is a collector type, they may not be satisfied until they have them all, and there are hundreds."
Just like I remembered!
Exactly what we ordered. Very pleased
Fun for the whole family! Easy for even younger kids to understand and play. Much quicker to play than monopoly Jr.
This is a legendary but effective way to teach our grandchildren basic money and economics; love it and so do our grandchildren!
My 6yr old daughter loves them. Arrived promptly and good price.
Love this. Daughter love it . Especially the the 5 figuring. Their so cute. The design of the board was a big surprise too. Great buy.
"It's just like I remember from when I was a kid. There's no frills, no extra changes to it, it's the original game of Monopoly that I wanted. The price was amazing and there was no sacrificing on product quality for the great deal I got."
My granddaughter loved these.
"My sisters Christmas gift, have played it with her and enjoyed it."
My son who is 13 collects Monopoly games.  It's a fun theme.  He was happy to add it to his collection.
"Lalaloopsy Girls Mittens is absolutely adorable!These girls line dolls are very cute and have a lot of the same characteristics as the regular dolls, the long thin limbs are already the standard based from the original dolls, and the styling and look are very similar as well. The biggest difference is the size of the doll (much smaller head and body, giving these more of a proportional, though still very characterized (and egg shaped :-P), look), pose-ability (the doll arms and legs stay where they are placed, and the doll can even stand on it's own!), and the cute little heart shaped mouth. I am very much looking forward to seeing more of the new girls dolls, and of course the more of the original and littles dolls too! A+ from me, Girls Mittens is a fun new imaginative addition to the family!"
"This monopoly game was made very cheap - the board is a piece of cardboard that just sits on the box.  It's hard to ""spin"" the spinner and the kids loose interest in playing it very quickly."
Daughter loved it !
My granddaughter loves playing the game.
Birthday present for my son's 9th birthday.  He definitely likes it.
It was nice and my kids like playing with their friends
I have a 4 and 6 yr old and they love this game!
"Great introduction to Monopoly, not to long, and interesting enough for mom and dad to join in (without wanting to rip their eyes out!)"
"My son loves it but its kind of hard to play. The board is cheap and it's hard to roll the minion ball without knocking over stuff. Definitely not for young kids who get frustrated easy. Also, it really isn't that much like monopoly kind of leaves something to be desired."
I bought this for my nephew who wanted Monopoly. He was so excited to have a special edition. It is now one of his favorite games.
Classic Game
Great old fashioned plain monopoly!! Priced perfect and shipped quick!!! Perfect family game!!
Very good
"We love the original Monopoly board so purchased this for a Christmas gift. The cat play piece is cute and a nice addition. The game arrived on time and in great condition. The grandchildren loved playing this game. It's great for learning the value of each money, counting and how to manage money as well, yet the kids are having fun not realizing they are learning!"
Brings back childhood memories and now there is a new player-a catGreat buy definetly worth the price
It's a board game. It was all there.
"I own a monopoly set which was being sold in stores around 2001, this new set while similar changed a couple of the game rules and material used too.Admittedly i like my older set better but that's because that's what i remember how some things were like. This new set changed the rules of how much money players start with and also the colors of the money. For example 50's from boards of the early 2000 era were blue now they are purple, the amount players start with is a minor change which is minuscule.The reason i state the money rules is a minuscule is because you can still use the old rules should you want to, however if players are going to go by the ''rules'' then its something to note in this new set.The cards are for properties are much smaller and of much thinner cardboard, the old ones from the 2000 era were much better quality. Kids already ripped some of the property cards because they were too thin , however do note if you own a monopoly set from the early 2000 era that the chance and treasure cards are better now.I have to double check but i believe some of the prices of the properties ( to buy) changed, the jewelry was 75.00 tax before now its $100. The income tax before was also 10% of your total money or $200 now its just $200.There used to be a pot of gold ornament, in this set its not included we kind of missed the pot of gold because we would use that to place it on top of the money we would put in the middle.Overall few changes which might bothered some players who have a set from the very early 2000's , some missing ornaments, and cheaper quality cardboard on some cards, if i could find the early 2000 monopoly boards i would just buy that instead of this new set in my opinion"
My daughter loved them
best price than Walmart. Kids love em. I love em. Thank you Amazon!
The game is very quick and easy to understand. My 8 year old niece had fun and no problem learning the game.
"It is a bit smaller than I original remember, and the rules are slightly changed as well. But still a lot fun to play with the kids."
"I hate monopoly but I love the kid versions of it. Me and my brother play and it is fun. Only two down sides that we found the whole spin the minion kind of annoying and the idea you NEED to buy what you land on it no fun, but it's your game make the rules your own. (Shhhhh lol)"
"this order came in two days I ordered one day in between and the three games arrived for our three mountain vacation homes.  They are perfect packed well I will order again when needed, We also bought party bingo which I love for our homes.StormyDaze"
I got the game board whithin 5 days of purchase. My nephews (one 7 year old and twin 5 year olds) were entertained for hours!
Quick shipping and the family loves the games!!!
Great Price for an old classic.
How could one ever go wrong with a Despicable Me movie purchase?  Wonderful for all ages.  Can't wait for the Minion Movie to come out.
Great!
kids enjoy them
"Granddaughter requested the Shopkins playset for Christmas, and I ordered these extra characters to go with it. She was happy with them."
Order was received quickly. Item was as described. No problems.
"Don't know why kids like these things, but they just do. No complaints about the quality."
If you get these for a kid make sure they don't have them already. The kids who collect these things are serious about them!!!
Like
My kid liked these
Sooooo cute!  My daughter uses them as accessories for her barbie kitchen .
purchased for my granddaughters they love Shopkins. will surely be buying more
"I live overseas and it arrived sooner than expected, in good condition.The game is fun for kids and fans of the franchise! Thanks!"
Despicable Me is the rave with most children.  Having these little characters in a traditional game is great.  Wish the set up was a bit easier.
"We have a couple versions of the regular Monopoly, Ponyopoly, and now Despicable Me2 Monopoly.  It is similar enough to the original that you will feel right at home with it and different enough with the spinner pit to be fresh and exciting.  The pit is also great at keeping the spinner on the table instead of chasing die under the chairs. The grandchildren gladly put the video games away so that they can play this with the grownups :)  This is now a family favorite right up there with Mexican Train.  The pieces are small but no smaller than the original Monopoly tokens.  We are going to buy the DM2 Pod game just so we can have more monopoly tokens.  As far as I am concerned there are no negatives.  It is much faster than reg Monopoly which is a plus when playing with really small children, we usually play at least two full games before anyone wants to move on to something else.  Great way to get a 4 yr old at the same game table as a ?? year old Grandmother and Grandpa, and every age in between.  Next on the list will be the DM Operation game.  Grandma loves having games and books for some old school entertainment with the grown kids and grandkids."
"The grandkids love this game.  It's easy to play and doesn't take forever like the real monopoly game.  The spinner isn't that great on it but we use dice, and the little minions are cute, tiny just like the real monopoly.  It's fast paced for them and easy to use - even my 6 year old grand daughter can be the banker.  Love it."
Who knew these would be so popular?! My daughter loves collecting them!
My daughter loves Shopkins.  She was very happy with the purchase.
My daughter loved it. And 2 months later she still plays with them.  :)
Perfect.
"I guess she liked them, bought them for 4 year old niece. They seem pretty silly to me but kids dig them."
"so cute. to me, these are the girls version of Pokemon. my 8 year old daughter was told in no uncertain terms that Pokemon is the domain of the boys. these little cutesies are for GIRLS only.  LIttle Yoghurts, flour and cutie pie kitchen items each have their own shopping bags. Adorable. Collect them all about 150"
"My grand daughter loved them. Her favorite color is blue, so she always goes to bed with the blue ones"
Item received quickly and was exactly what I expected.
Daughter loves them
I'm very happy with this product I love that it came within  two days of me ordering it I will be ordering from you guys again
"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my niece's little 5 year old boy.  He had seen the movie and loved it.  As soon as I could, I starting looking for this product.  Hasbro products have been around for a very long time.  I can remember buying toys from this company for my own children so many years ago.  I could not locate it on any other website or store.  I purchased it quickly and shipped it directly to her home.  I was told that it was his favorite gift which is an understatement as he received so many gifts from ""Santa"" as well as from other family members.  Luckily for me and the little guy I found it on Amazon!!"
The details in this game are perfect. It is a lot faster paced than regular monopoly so that is good when you don't have a lot of time for a game. Very fun lil minion game pieces.
"we have played it with our two kids, 10 and 7. The really enjoy the despicable me movies and that carried through to the game. The game is certainly more basic than full monopoly but is just right for elementary kids."
My niece flipped out when she received this - it's so different.  The graphics are adorable.  Super for a Minion or DM fan
"This game is for younger children.  It is fun, cute and easy to play.  I would say 8 and under would like it best, but my older kids liked it, too.  The minions are extra fun to play with when the game is over."
This is a cute little game.  It is similar to Monopoly Jr.  My biggest complaint is the spinning minion for determining how many spaces to move.  It just doesn't work well!  You're better off using a regular die.  It's a quick game for if you don't want a regular marathon of Monopoly.
"the game is for my kids.  my son is a huge fan of Despicable Me, so i figured the game would be a great christmas gift.  he and his sister love it."
I think this product would be great for anyone aged 8+.  I played regular Monopoly as a child & this is far superior!
"This game is a number one hit with my minion loving 6 year old.  The minnion top ""spinner"" is too cute.  Unlike traditional monopoly this game goes by much faster which is good for a six year olds attention span. Excellent family fun.  We played on christmas with my 80 year old parents and we all had fun."
"I got this for my son and his wife, never to old to play monopoly!  Packaging was good and the item arrived on time and perfect."
"My kids found this game a lot of fun. It's very cute and doesn't take all day to play a game like the original Monopoly can. The spinner is kind of a pain - doesn't really spin so much as it flops around, but the kids didn't mind. I doubt the tray top game board will hold up to a lot of use, but so far it has been fine. This game is great for working on simple math skills - very basic addition and subtraction when buying properties, etc."
"This was a great Christmas gift, my niece was so excited when she received it.also arrived on time was very pleased this."
My 4 year-old got this game as a gift and he really likes it.  I like that it is something that the whole family (any age) can play and have fun with.  We had our 8 year-old cousin over and she really liked it too.  I purchased this for a friends little one.  I would recommend it to others.
Love the game...it took a few spins to get it good...but is really fun!! Kids love it!! Great family fun
My 9 year old really wanted this game. We didn't realize that it's a Jr. Monopoly game. Actually it's a dumbed down version if Jr Monopoly. My 7 & 4 year old often play it together with out a need for help.
Adorable.
FOR MY KIDS EXCELLENT GIFT
terrific
Good enough
I really liked these! This is the first time getting any sshopkins! My pack came and it was like the photo! 10 sshopkins you could see and 2 in the basket that I had to unwrap. The great thing is the 2 in the basket are both ultra rare! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because one of my shopkins which was a rare one had a flaw. It had a black strip area and on one corner the black was missing and showed green. But other than that I loved them. My son loves them so much he asks me almost everyday to play with them!
super
My daughter loved these!
They were the best gift ever... We all love them... Amazing  little toys.
"Bought these for my daughter, we ordered 2 and luckily they were 2 different ones instead of the same"
as advertised
Good family game to give as a family gift.
Does the job cant ask for more
You probably know the game - great for family and friends. The box came on time and in great quality.
it was good but the quality isnt that great. the monopoly money was very thin and the board itself could rip at any time.
Gift for my grandkids
"I bought this classic game for my 9-year-old son for Christmas. He LOVES it and wants to play all the time. Which as you know, because it is Monopoly, requires a huge time commitment. But hey, family bonding and all that. It's a hit, and Amazon's price was good."
I love it and
classic
Great Product!
Just like I remember!
They are small but cute.  Please buy something to store them. Once you buy some you will buy more
Bought these in addition to the Shopkins Supermarket and organizer. My daughter loves them.
kids love them
Satisfied. Thanx!
Fun family game. Its good to play a game different than tje original monopoly.  My family loves minions. Got it for my 12 year old as a Christmas gift!
"This is an interesting take on monopoly. Not a fan of how you have to set up the board every time. Game goes pretty quick. Kids love it, (5 year old boy 7 year old girl)"
my grand daughters love the game and play a lot of games it's good quality time they have heaps of fun
"This game is a simplified version of monopoly, but we love it because it is easy for the kids to understand and they love choosing which minion they are going to be.  They get the concept of money and playing by the rules, which they do not seem to mind.  I love the custom minion pieces that came with the game and rolling the minion with the banana is a blast."
My daughter loves minions and both movies.  That has made this game something she very much enjoys.  Much more simplistic than the original monopoly.
Such a fun and easy game for kids and adults alike. I ordered this and it arrived super fast and was easy to set up.
"This version doesn't take as long as the original monopoly and it's more fun in my opinion.  My girls love Despicable Me so they really enjoy playing this game.  It has fewer properties than the original monopoly which is probably why the game goes faster.  And things aren't as expensive as the original.  You have minion dollars as opposed to monopoly money and you put cupcakes or sundaes on the properties (as opposed to hotels,etc..)  It's a cute fun game and well worth owning."
My son (5 yrs old) wants to play this game over and over.  Can't get enough of it espcially because he loves the Despicable Me characters.  Great idea for young kids.
"My grandkids love the minions and have enjoyed playing this minion monopoly game.  If you love monopoly and love the Despicable Me movies, then this is the game for you."
"This is great for my 5, 6, 9 & 10 year old! It is ""like"" monopoly but it's a LOT shorter and more fun. The game probably takes about 20 minutes to play. If you love minions you will love this game."
It's good
Six year old grandson loved Monopoly.  I was torn between getting the Monopoly Jr. and Monopoly. I went Monopoly and it's great. Think he's a competitive little lad!
Classic game!
MY SONS YOUNG FAMILY LOVED THIS GREAT SET FOR ALL AGES TO PLAY TOGEATHER AN HAVE AFUN TIME WITHOUT THE TV GAMES THAT OLNY KILLS THE CHILD OFRF AT AN EARLY AGE SO THEYNEVER REALY ENJOY READING OF THEIR OWN LITTLE WOLD OF MAKE BELIEVE  T.REED
It's monopoly. tho it has some new rules i'm not familiar with.
Christmas gift for neighbors. They love the new pieces
Classic game.
"This is a classic game I loved playing growing up. I purchased it this year as a new game for my family to play together during the holiday break. While we've enjoyed played this game, I'm a little disappointed that the board itself, started to tear after the first use. It's really frustrating that games are being cheaply made. Back in the day a game board would last countless uses before showing any wear, and this board gets used once and is already starting to fall apart.The reason for the 4 stars, is aside from the cheaply made board, everything else is great. The pieces, cards, houses, hotels, dice and cards are all well constructed. We've enjoyed playing the game. I was very happy with the price and quick shipping from Amazon."
I didn't have to spend much on it so my feelings won't be as hurt when my students lose pieces.
Good value for money! Our family loves the classic monopoly!
Puen producto
Kids loved it.
My daughter loves playing with these! They are great!
For a Granddaughter.  She loves them!
these things are totally not worth the money
My kid loves these!  She has had a blast playing with them.  They arrived promptly as well.
Product as described.
"Granddaughters have enjoyed this toy, it has held up !!"
i love it and i love how it ships in time
My Granddaughter loved them.
Super easy set up and play makes this ideal for elementary kids!! My 8 year old had it up and ready in 5 minutes.
"As a collector of Monopoly games this is an adorable addition to my collection, that is a blast to play with my family and friends. Only a minor complaint would be that the box got damaged in shipping and affects the value."
This game is very fun! I love how it has its own way of gameplay thats incorporated into the movie.
I bought this as a Christmas present for my 7 year nephew. We had a great time playing it.  Easy to play love the little figurines but mostly he enjoyed it.
"My son and I played this game, we had a lot of fun together. It was easy and simple to play. I just wish the chance card has more variety."
"Great Game.  Much quicker than Monopoly but still fun.  4 year old and 6 year old love the game.  We did modify it and put the board on the table so you could use the spinner without bumping the game board.  The boys even said, maybe we could just use a dice to make it easier!But fun game!"
My kids love this game! It's easy enough that our 3 year old can play with us too! I only wish it was for more than 4 player's so our family of 5 could all play together.
My grandkids loved the game...were hoping to get it.  My 9 yr. old played it several times with her cousin!
"This was cute and my nephew was super excited, but I think it could use a few more variations to make it fun for younger children."
"This game is really fun for kids.  It is a lot shorter than normal monopoly.  My kids wanted to switch up the rules to buy properties from each other, but we played according to the box directions.  It was fun and didn't last too long like regular monopoly.  My 7 year old and 10 year old had a lot of fun playing with mommy.  We want to shop for more little minions because you can collect them and they are so darn cute!  The way you spin the little minion with the banana makes it fun and more exciting than just using dice.  We loved it.  Fun game!!"
"My daughter requested these for Christmas so Santa delivered. She loved them. I had no idea what they were, but she saw them on some youtube videos she watches. Her pack came with some that were ""extra rare"" so she was happy."
good
Granddaughter very happy with gift.
Gift
granddaughters love Shopkins.
I bought this for my Grand niece as a Christmas gift for her and she loved it. Come sin very tiny pieces so you have to be carful because it pose as a choking hazard and not recommended for toddlers.
"Good product, as describe. Arrived on time."
She loves these funny little guys.....
Shopkins were at the top of my 5 year old granddaughter's Christmas list.  I ordered a 5 pack and a 12 pack.  They arrived swiftly and were well packaged.  Good thing...I had to reassure her every day for 2 weeks that I would be giving her Shopkins for Christmas.  I put them under the tree as soon as they came.  She was very happy when she opened the first set and ecstatic when she opened the second package.
Perfect condition!!!!!!!
It's Monopoly the American's dream game....
It arrived on time. Great game for the entire family. I would recommend.
"A long, long time ago they should've included the cat.  I love this game and now it's even better.  The product arrived in great shape and quickly.  I have several versions of Monopoly, played it for years, and hope to play it for years to come.  Highly recommend it."
As expected
Kids love it; the product was affordable.
"Bought as a gift, and the recipient reported that they love it!"
Came in new condition as promised. Very happy
Who doesn't love Monopoly?? Especially for the right price!
Great price.
Very nice family game
Excellent value!
My 7 year old is totally into Shopkins.
And my daughters LOVE it...
My granddaughter loves it.
"My daughter is loco about Shopkins.  She has now close to a hundred of them, some are gifts on her recent birthday and some we bought for her.  This pack is part of a review sample item that we received from the manufacturer.You get to see the 10 Shopkins right away when you get a 12-pack.  The other two are hidden inside blue blind bags (that is how my daughter calls them).  The other two are the rare ones or special editions that you won't have to see until you open the pack.  Each pack depending on what season has a list of Shopkins with their names, categories, if they are rare or special ed...and it looks like a shopping list.  You can check them if you already have one.She has the bakery, vegetable stand and the Supermarket with a spiral slide.  By the way you can connect the Vegetable stand and the bakery together into one long Shopkin store.  There is a connector on the end of each shop.  She loves to play pretend and present me her own show of talking Shopkin like they are in a play.If she gets a duplicate, she likes to trade them with other Shopkins that she doesn't have with her classmates who also have duplicates.  She said it is part of the fun."
"This is truely a fun game. It was very easy for my 4 year old to understand the directions. After only a few times playing the game he even understood and did extremely well being the banker. The game pieces are cute, and the spinner very inventive."
My 10 year old son bought this for himself and he loves playing it. I've always found monopoly boring but we all enjoy playing it together. We have no issues with its quality. It is the classic game . It's good for him too to be the banker and practice his math skills.
Fast shipping. Love playing this all time classic with my young Grandson.
Still Monopoly but definitely still not the same quality! At first I thought it was me but my husband agreed. Pieces are so much smaller than they used to be. It's an obvious case of cut back on size/quality to keep the price low. Curious to see how well it holds up to 3 boys.
Love it
Classic fun family game. The only thing I'm not happy with is they have changed the plastic money tray so that the money cannot just lay flat in the slots now.
Great Family Fun this yar at Christmas
Classic monopoly and a great price. Has the cat token in this game.
I BUY ONE EVERY CHRISTMAS FOR FAMILY GAME NIGHT !!!!
"This particular set has a nifty built-in plastic molded compartment for storing the Monopoly Money and deeds during play.  Seems simple, but not every set has this useful feature.  Bankers and deed holders will be very pleased!"
It was fine. Kids loved playing it.
Santa did well..daughter was pleased!!
The kids loved them
The kid loves them.
great
so cute!!!
best thing ever
love it
outstanding
"Item arrived on time as described. If you never saw them, they are very tiny, only about 1"" high. My granddaughter is 8 and she loves them."
"Granddaughter is obsessed with these things.  They are cute and very collectible.  Kinda overpriced, but whatever.  She loves them!"
My daughter plays for hours with her sister and these little toys are cute.Just be careful that you don't give to babies or if there is babies in the house with choking hazard.
arrived on time and my niece was very happy she got shopkins for Christmas!!
Great toy.
awesome my daughter loves them
This was the first time I have every purchased Shopkins. My 4 year old daughter talked about them non-stop! She was not disappointed! They are very cute made from a quality hard plastic. She loves not knowing which one she's got until she opens it up!
As described
"Gift for granddaughter, she has to learn how to play"
This classic game was purchased for Toys For Tots. Every child should have the pleasure of playing Monopoly. Merry Christmas!
I am very impressed with the high quality of this product!! All of the parts are very durable and will last a long time. Great buy!!
Grand Daughter love them
Perfect.  Slow shipping.  Must be a stock thing.
It shut my little sister up.
"Don't do it, if you've never bought shopkins, don't. If you have, well here they are and hey at least these are less than a buck each, cause you know you gotta get like a hundred more before your kid will stop begging for them.."
"Great, and fun for my daughter to play with, the shopkins was cute. Amazon did a great job in sending then items over to Malaysia. Thanks."
3 year old loves them. Good purchase good price.
My 5 yr old daughter is obsessed with shopkins! Very happy with this purchase especially since they are hard to find in stores now
Shopkins
Great product but the exact same item is at Sam's for 50 percent less
"This turned out be a great gift for someone who loves despicable me, especially the minions! She loves the game."
I gave this as a christmas present to a seven year old.  It was simple enough for his age he really loved it!
"My 5 and 7 year old really enjoy this game and played it 4 times within the first day.  They were able to understand the rules very quickly.  The game is complete luck and favors the youngest (they go first) so if you are looking for a strategy game this is not what you want.  It is a fun game, with characters my kids like, that is easily learned and doesn't take too long to finish.  They love the minion pieces and spinning ""nom nom"" to see how far they move each turn.Warning: there may be disputes about where ""nom nom"" lands.  I recommend having a ""ref"" that settles disputes - just name them at the beginning of the game like you decided the banker.  Anyone who argues with the ref gets a warning then gets sent to the jail space if the argument continues.  This worked perfectly when I played with them and no one actually had to go to jail."
This is a fun way to play a short game of monopoly. My child is 12 and played it several times with myself and her friends at a sleepover.
Was disappointed in the whole setup of the game - the spinner thing is dumb and doesn't work very well.  Wanted a real Monopoly board/game like the rest of the Monopoly games. The money is so tiny - and the gameplay is too short. :(
"i bought this as a gift for my nephews birthday. he loved it, so i cant complain.This is a good buy."
The game is really cute with spinning minions as the dice. Its a smaller set compared to regular monopoly hence suitable for younger kids. I enjoyed the game with my boys.
Game was not as exciting as I thought it would be. If only the board was bigger and if we did not have to spin for each turn. A dice would've been better because it was hard to tell what we had landed on.
Fun game and great choice for someone who loves any of the Despicable Me movies!! I got this for my sister and she loves it!! We play it at game night!
no issues
These are all the rave on YouTube. I looked for them at my local stores and no one carries them. My daughter loves them!
Bought this set to accompany the Fruit & Vegetable Playset. These things are adorable and my 5 year old loves them.
Can't wait to play with my kids!
"My daughter loves these SHOPKIN products.  Be very mindful, however, of WHAT Seller you purchase from as LOU'S DEAL$ sends counterfeit ones.  Buyer Beware!"
Always a good game !
My kids love it
Awesome! Just like the old days...
My kids love these
I thought it was an interesting and entertaining game. Don't forget fun too.
great toy
It was exactly what I wanted and more.
"My daughter loves these!  They are a great prize for her for completing chores, etc."
This is a great game if you have hours to spare. By now you would think the community chest and chance cards qould either be plastic or laminated.  For tge price of the game i expect those cards to be laminated. Or at least thise cards sold separately aling with houses & hotels. Otherwise your buying a whole new game if you lose the pieces
"What can I say, it's monopoly! Best board game to add to your collection of games. My 8 year old son loves it too!"
Purchased as a gift.
Nice
Cute. Fast delivery
A latest trend with little kids these days.  My little one loves these things.
Very cute...kids gift and they loved them
great
junk
daughter loves it
"As much as my 5 year old daughter loves these Shopkins, I am disappointed as a customer because this 12 pack came as three 5 packs. Normally it would be great to get 15 instead of 12 Shopkins, although 2 of these packs I received were identical. There was also no larger shopping basket or surprise Frozen themed Shopkins as pictured with the 12 pack. We kept it because she opened them for Christmas and I couldn't make her wait for me to exchange them."
Our daughter fell in love with ALL of the Shopkins characters from Season 1 !  I am almost positive that we'll be ordering more in the very near future.
My 5 year old niece loves these little things
Kids love it
The new craze for my little girl. I was able to get it when it was $8.99 which a great deal compared to how much a 12-pack is at the store. She enjoyed them.
"I ordered 2 of these from Amazon. One of them that I received was an open box with no celophane wrapping. Even though it looks like all the contents are there, I'm a bit disappointed because it was intended to be a gift!!"
I'm hoping that the Grand kids love their x-mas present which is a board games has much has I & their parents did!
"My young granddaughter (me too, we play together) is delighted with all her new Shopkins toys.  We're using 5"" character dolls as shoppers.  While Barbie and such works fine, if you made ""Shopkins Doll Shoppers"" to go the toy I would give you a 5 star rating.  Nice toy, bright, cheerful and keeps child's focus for long time.  Have made additional Shopkins purchases in store."
Awesome
My daughters and I love the game.Thanks Santa Claus! :)Very fun game if you like the monopoly games.
"If you enjoyed the movie, you will enjoy this. It is based on the 2nd movie.. very cute concept and simple to play. Play does not last too long like most Monopoly games. One note.. pieces are SMALL.. keep a baggie to keep them all in... otherwise you will lose them. Very fun.. for adults alike too. You will enjoy playing this with your child."
"Well-planned game, with less of the ""real"" monopoly rules and regulations......great starter for younger family members, but still challenging for adults.  You really need 4 players; with two it gets monotonous and play lasts too long. But minion fans will have tons of fun on family night!"
This was a Christmas present for family members. The kids were excited to get it. It was a great price.
my kids love this game.  It's lots of fun and easy to set up.  The little Minion guys can double as action figure play for later.  just don't forget to put them back in the box when you need them for next game!
Best bday present ever for a lil kid?game is age appropriate and the minions are so cute n adorable .
The kids had fun because of minion rather than the game itself. The minion tokens are a little flimsy but I'm happy because the kids are satisfied!
"Simple rules of the 5-7 crowd.  Very cute method of play.  My family loves to play this game together, teaches game rules, not complicated what so ever.  We got it months ago and still play a couple times a month.  Family favorite.  Makes a great gift."
I bought this after my son (age 8) and I saw Despicable Me 2 and he loves it! It's a much simpler version of Monopoly and the characters are hilarious.
Cool. I like it. It was packaged just the way I imagined it to be. Couldn't be more amazing than that.
Bought 2 for gifts and its very cute.  My kids love this edition.  The cost was less than toys r us.
Not sold in Singapore so made very unique gifts to friends and the minions tokens in colour is very attractive not only to kids but adults as well.
my granddaughter will love these.came in rather quickly! always a bonus when that happens.
These are awesome. My daughter collects them.  This comes with 4 standard shopkins and a SURPRISE shopkin.  They make a great gift and stocking stuffer.
Exactly what she wants!
Great
Love shopkins!  Next going to get series 2!
They are cute
"I first will say I was astonished  a t the price of these little Shopkins.  I bought the twenty (20) pack for my Granddaughter.  The package was as light as cotton.  My Granddaughter was super excited at getting the package mailed and opened it immeditely.  She has been playing with these little figures non-stop & there is no limit to her imagination.  This, by itself, makes them more worthwhile.I bought them for her for her 7th birthday.  She is now making a list for other family members to purchase them & not repeat what she already owns.  It's so nice to see something enjoyed and appreciated so much as is this birthday gift.  I congratulate the inventor, the marketer and myself - it's win, win all around."
excellent!
We will buy more soon.  6 yr old loves these
The item was exactly as described. The only downside is was the exact same package my daughter already had. If you were able to choose the pack I think it would be super helpful. Otherwise it is a great product with fast shipping just as promised.
Good qaulity
Purchased this for my granddaughter as she wanted this soo much. She will be surprised when I give this to her this weekend!  Came early!
"My Daughter and I collect different versions of Monopoly, and decided to add this to our collection. It's cute and simple! Definitely would be even more fun for young kids (younger than teens)."
A new twist on a classic game.  This game is fun for families and gives you time together away from TV.
would love to collect all the little figures. Easy to put together. The minion spinner works really well. It makes a quick games instead of the normal long drawn out Monopoly
"When we played real monopoly, it would go on for days. Or never be completed. This is great. It's short, there is an end in sight and kids are happy they played monopoly. For young players, this gets 5 stars! Only thing is the spinner is ridiculous. We now play with a dice and that works out well."
Great play pieces. The kids really seemed to like this game and adults are not bored. I would buy it as a gift
"Awesome game with cute little minions.  I would give it a higher rating but the build quality was a bit shotty.  I mean, it's a board game.  There is no board.  You use the box and a cardboard cut out to play the game.  I guess times have changed and they don't make things the way they used to.  Oh well...still not bad."
I'm not sure what the attraction is but my six year old daughter does and that is good enough for me!
Daughter received these for Christmas. loves them!!!
Granddaughter loved them.
"I received 2 common, 2 rare, and 1 ultra rare in my pack. This is a good Shopkins starter pack for your collection!"
I gave this 5 stars because my kids love them.  I do not.  They are small. I step on them frequently. I do not know where they are when asked.  But....my kids love them.
I bought two as it says styles may vary but ended up getting both of the same sets.  Oh well.
My daughter is very happy
Purchased a bunch of these for a Christmas present for my niece and she LOVES them.
We love the classic version of this game. Great buy!
Received in great condition
Great game!
Kids loved it!  Great Monopoly that has been around so many years!
Absolutely worth the money.The fast version with the red cube is a lot of fun.
We played this game the day it arrived.  Great fun.
My son simply loves it. Great gift!
Great price. My daughter loves these little things.
Great
Purchased these items for my daughter and niece to add to the stocking. They watch the you tube videos on shopkins and always ask for them so I figured they would be a great stocking stuffer
Ordered for someone else for a Christmas gift
It is ok!  Granddaughter loved it.
Daughter loves it
Granddaughter loved them
:)
Perfect gift for adults who behave like kids and game nights!I particularly liked how different / similar it is to actual Monopoly.
Perfect purchase!!
The game itself is meant for a younger generation but it came packaged wonderfully and in a great amount of time would buy from seller again
"My daughter loved it, she is 4 years old and is an educational and fun game she likes to play. If you are a monopoly fan don't miss it! The only downfall would be that the minion you insert into the spinner is kind of loose but overall its well crafted and with good quality."
I love the way the game is played and it stays quite true to the movie. The tokens are cute but you can get tired of the simple gameplay. Strictly for fans and kids.
"A cute game for small children interested in learning to play Monopoly is probably its only function.  If you absolutely love the movie(s), it's worth a try.  Else, it's a pass."
"I like the original Monopoly and Monopoly Jr although my daughter has nearly the worst luck imaginable at the latter. This game lies between the two. Apparently the designers thought that the game was too complicated for the target audience, so only 1 banana dollar units are included, i.e. no higher denomination banknotes, even though you have to fork over as much as 6 banana dollars at a time. (Or they failed to put all of the money packs in. I did not see a content list so cannot say.) But instead of using colored markers like in Monopoly Jr, they use the complicated card system of the original Monopoly. This also slows the game. Instead of a die, they use a spinner. I have no idea how well small kids can twirl their fingers, but if they have problems, then this game will be difficult as is. If you are playing on a bed, then the box is not level and the spinner keeps going to one side of the box and so we rolled almost exclusively 6, 2, and 5 throughout the game. Only bad spins ended up on the other side. We had to respin a number of times when the banana fell half on one side of the line and half on the other. (Where the banana in the figurine's hand lands determines the number.) When the spinner goes under the ledge, it can be particularly difficult to read. The figurines are painted, soft, super-flexible plastic. How long the paint will stay on I have no idea, but the paint job is not fantastic. They urge kids to collect all 50 minions, but I am not sure where one is supposed to do that and it appears all the boxes contain the same minions. I cannot imagine these figures being worth anything in years to come.  On the plus side, any of the five minions included can be attached to the spinner, but they mostly do not have a small item in their hand for indicating the number. The figures and the sundae markers do not have a wide base, so the slightest bump and they fall over or even off of the board, which is raised, making them go even further. I have trouble imagining most young kids not bumping the board, esp. a raised board where they have to reach inside to pick up and spin the spinner. This means you are constantly in danger of losing your place at a moment's notice. Everything except the plastic choking hazards and the spinner is made of unprotected cardboard or paper. So cleaning up after sticky fingers is a problem. My daughter bought this game because she is enamored with everything minion at the moment, but I cannot see here playing with this Monopoly version very much for the above reasons."
It is a very good game it is the best my family and I play each night it is excellent
"I haven't played yet, but the cute minions figures and fun have me excited to play this new version of Monopoly."
fun game. my 9 year old plays it and just loves the minions! great item for the price. love it!
"This version of Monopoly is cool and unique to both children and collectors.  In this video, I explain both points of view."
Classic game to love and learn. My step daughter is 6 and we are slowly teaching her how to play. It is amazing :)
my kid loves it..
PERFECT !  PASS GO !  A +
:)
"It's the real game. I thought maybe not, since it was cheaper."
"This is a classic board game I bought on a whim one day.  It's absurdly fun to play this with friends, and it brings back great memories.  The box arrived completely intact, and all the pieces were there and accounted for."
"After long time of using electronics and being my family and kids away from each other, I decided to buy this game and get the family together.I love it doesn't have too complicated stuff. Material are good. To be honest, I love it especially when we sit together and play as a family. It worth more than its price, highly recommended."
This was for a gift.  This game is classic and will never disappoint.  Everything came as expected.
all of us like this game very much. easy to play and really nice. the cat is so cute. it is m
"Nice game, but dont have original pieces nor original money nor cards :/."
My daughter LOVES Shopkins. She loves the video reviews on YouTube and had heard of these from there. Even though she was spoiled with hundreds of dollars worth of Christmas gifts - this was by far her favorite. The price was excellent and she loves collecting these. It arrived quickly and there was a good variety. I think she'll be a fan and collect these for some time!
My Daughter loved them!
My granddaughter was enthralled.
My grand-daughter loves it! Although a bit pricey!
These things are so cute for my little girls. She is 8 and she loves them.  I just hope she doesn't lose them!  I just wish they made it easier to collect.
Perfect! Just what my daughter wanted!
My Granddaughter has fallen in love with them. I found them to be pretty cool. We have decided to collect them all.
very good
Cute toy.My 8 years daughter loves this shopping cute guys.
exceeded all expectations
My 10 y/o loved them! She wants me to order more. They were as advertised and delivered quickly.
Just as expected.
Daughter loved it
Granddaughter enjoyed these very much if they make her happy they make me happy.

My little Rose loves these.  Great quick service.
They put I big smile on a little girl's face and that's what a good toy is supposed to do.
"Fast, efficient, as advertised."
Love it
Don't like the new version of monopoly.  Not the same as when I was a kid... I don't even know how to play very confusing.
Bought several of these for secret santa this Christmas and you cannot go wrong with Monopoly for $7! It's a great secret santa gift for the young and old. Great family game!
A gift not yet given
Maybe this is not the most durable version of Monopoly that's available but it's complete and plays just fine. A good value for the price!
Fast shipping. Product arrived as described. Thank you!
same classic game
"Old fashioned monopoly, nothing extra, nothing fancy - just good old fun."
This has the fun speed die and also the best directions ever.
I bought this for my 9-year-old son. He loves Monopoly and this one is much shorter than the regular game.
good
I bought this for my Grand niece as a Christmas gift for her and she loved it. Come sin very tiny pieces so you have to be carful because it pose as a choking hazard and not recommended for toddlers.
Arrived as expected. Great gift.
5 and 10 Year old daughters received for Christmas and love to play with it!
"As my grand daughter open the myriad of gifts I had gotten her for Christmas, she screamed that high pitched scream of pure joy when she opened this one. She was thrilled to the bone. As long as I live, I'll never understand the kids who get caught up in the collection business todays useless and silly toys. All of her friends have these creatures- so it's a contest of sorts.In my time it was Barbie dolls. Today it's Shopkins. She went nuts, b/c she didn't have these particular ones.So I remain Queen for bribing ''Santa'' to find these for her. Thanks Amazon, You rule!"
"Great Deal, Toy of the Year!"
"kids love there things, great alternative to squinkies if your kids were into them."
"This toy set came in in perfect condition and as advertised. It contains small pieces so care must be taken around smaller children. Otherwise, it was worth the order. The prompt service and well packaging was noteworthy. Highly recommended."
Daughter loved it
"girls really are enjoying it. did not think they would, but turns out they really like it and play with it regularly"
My granddaughter enjoyed the shopkind
Bought this for my nieces 5th birthday and she loves them!
My daughter loves them!
"My 4 year old daughter absolutely LOVES these.  She plays with them every day and I've had them for about a month now.  She doesn't get tired of them and she loves to learn their names.  I would recommend them for any little ones, but I wouldn't get them for anyone under the age of 4."
My daughter was real excited to get them
Christmas present. for a couple young men.
"My kids love these for some reason, so I'm happy"
We enjoy playing board games so this game is a must have.
"This brings me back to my childhood. Super fun, and the kids love it!"
I received a package but wasn't the one pictured i called but was told should just order another one. This was horrible experience I wound up ordering the correct one off ebay
Students loved this game
Awesome!
Addictive for little 4 year old.
my daughter loved these as we have only just got these in AustraliaShe was over the moon
Great game
"Love, love, love these shopkins!!!!!"
We got all new Shopkins (We didn't have any of them in our collection) and for the surprise shopking we got a limited edition!They are cute and my daughter loves the broccoli lol
"Man, what a RACKET this toy company has going!  They sucker you into buying lots of these, until your child has completed her (or his?) collection.  And what makes it a nightmare for some like myself, is that your child often EXPECTS to find the super-rare 'Limited Edition' Shopkins, which of course, is simply not attainable for most!  Try telling a crying 'special needs' child that you'll eventually find 'Tina Tuna' or 'Cupcake Queen', after already having spent hundreds of dollars on these stupid, addictive things!  I just can't afford to spend $800 on Ebay for 'Cupcake Queen' in order to quell the cries and dissapointment of a child, who otherwise doesn't understand!  These darn things are a major headache for many parents!  The company should 'provide an out' for those parents that wish to purchase the super rare, limited edition Shopkins at a very reasonable cost!  How about selling the super rare ones on your website, but not have them numbered?  This way, the serial numbered ones would remain rare for those who found them, and the non-numbered ones would be common, and still come with a non-numbered 'certificate' to appease children!"
"Great game, great price!"
great
Just plain simple Monopoly at a great price.
"Great all time favorite game. Kids nowadays are too attach to their technology, having monopoly at our house helps show them that board games are fun, and you don't need all that technology to have fun."
Fun
good deal
Great price and fast shipping!
10/10
"I ordered this game to help teach my children to count money fast but in a fun way. When I opened the box, all my childhood memories came back and it was such a pleasure. I can't wait to play this with my kids. The price was phenomenal and the shipping was fast. This is one game that has lasted generations and will continue to be a favorite in every household."
Its the classic!Just what I was looking for to bring back childhood memories!  What more could you ask for?  Oh yea...2 day Prime Shipping!  Love Amazon!
I always wanted a Shopkin but now I have lots.
These are the current popular thou. My daughter was thrilled to get these.
My daughters love these toys.
"Great product,  4 year old girl loves them and we enjoy going thru her lists with her. They are very cute!"
Bought for a granddaughter - she was very pleased with the item.
"I have no idea why my 5&8 year olds wanted these, but they sure seem to play with them a whole lot"
My kid is having the time of her life  lol
They are awesome because and they are so cute also they have awesome names!
"I ordered two and they were exactly the same, such a disappointment. My daughter wants to collect them all, not get 10 of the same Shopkins. :( I didn't bother opening the other yet. Description says styles may vary, but not in this case."
The product was sipped to mevright away.
little one loved it
Purchased for grandson at his request.  He and his brother love the product as well as receiving something in the mail.
what can you say.  monopoly has always been fun.  this game is no different.  great price and shipped fast.
She loves these and plays with them all the time. Arrived as expected.
Perfect
Great old game for bringing the family together.
The sipment was fast. The product is better than I remember (I especially like who the game references some of the more common 'house rules' you may have heard of or played)Made for a great addition to game night
Perfect.
This was my daughter's favorite toy for Christmas. Thanks for having this product and shipping it in an expedited manner.
My niece loved adding them to her collection.
granddaughter loved them
So cute my daughter loves them and price is great! Only downfall of buying online is that you have a good chance of getting package you already have.
Just as described!
cute
Great! Bought 2 packs together and they included different Shopkins.
They were a hit with our granddaughter! It's what she wanted.
Great quality and service-would use this seller again.
"Every once in a while I play Monopoly again, then I tell myself I'll never play Monopoly again..."
Excellent family game
"Grandchildren discovered this game at summer cabin. Great way to learn how to handle ""money"" and plan. At 7 and 10 this will be a winter family game and for years to come."
Excellent in every way
Great deal.
Classic game and quality great.  Cheaper than stores. No complaints for quality and service =)
Thanks
This is a great quality board and pieces. I would definitely recommend this.
Got them for our grand daughter she loves them
"Going through the reviews, I was in doubt whether to buy it or no. Since it's sold by Amazon, I decided to buy it. However, after buying it I found that it's quality is really fine, and the only thing that I didn't like is that it has a fourfold board rather than a bi fold one.One side of the square board (which obviously has four sides) has a cut (profecianally made and looks nice)  from the middle of the side towards the center of board to allow folding. This weakens it from centre, might  also get it torn but less likely. That is the only thing that I didn't like. Rather than this it is almost perfect for me. And for the price of 7.84 $ I feel that I am obligated to give 5 stars."
"My niece L-O-V-E-D these little Shopkins! They are adorable and surprisingly sturdy little things. She was so excited that there was a secret one hiding in a separate package. She loves surprises. Now I'm on a mission to help her collect them all, of course. These went over so well with her (she'll be six in November) that I'm looking into getting the little play-sets that go with the tiny figures. My niece loves small toys and these really encourage imaginative play. What kind of adventures do a chocolate bar and a hairbrush get into? The best kind! :) Then you put them in their individual shopping bags for sweet dreams."
Never too old for Monopoly~!
Nice
Amazon Warehouse deals are the best.
"Family game at a family price! We're prone to board flipping tantrums, and this one is holding up remarkably well!"
It's Monopoly!  What more can I say!
How can you not love Monopoly? Even better when you can get it  for less than the retail stores and 2-day shipping from Prime.
My daughter loves this it's all she talks about now
it exactly meets what I want?
Exactly what I ordered! She absolutely loves them.
My granddaughters were thrilled to get their own shopkins.  My daughter couldnt find them in any stores..
It's was cute my six year old granddaughter loved it.
Very cute set. My granddaughter loves them.
Purchased as a Christmas gift!  It was one of the top gifts!
Another fad.....
Great product! Finally toy collectables for girls. The 12 pack comes with 12 shopkins of which 2 are in a blind basket. The shopkins in the blind basket can be limited editions.
We love Shopkins over here! Make sure you dig in the basket for the two hidden ones!!! I almost threw them away! Oops!!!
Very nice products and fast shipping
4 yr old daughter loved this set!!
"My 7 year old daughter has been asking for shopkinz for months and I couldn't ever find them in local stores... She was thrilled with them for Christmas! Her favorite gift, exactly what she expected!! She likes using them to play with her dolls, and she wants to collect them all... Especially loves the excitement and surprise of not knowing exactly which shopkinz she will get with each package!! Thanks for the good experience!"
Bought as a gift for my Granddaughter!
Bought as gift for my niece along with the fruit and vegetables playset. She said I was her favorite uncle.
So much fun!! My son loves these
My daughter just got them this morning for Christmas. For some reason these little Shopkins were her favorite of all the gifts. If I had known that I would have gotten more of them and skipped the more expensive gifts.
exactly what she wanted
Kids love them.
this game is awesome for friends and family
I really like that they have a cat in there now
"So glad I could get it for her, it came right on her birthday"
Everything went very well . My granddaughter loves them. Now she wants to collect the gold collection I got it fast and I would buy again from this person
My girl loved thees shopkins! She brings tham every ware she goes!
I bought this for my granddaugthter.  The pieces are so small and don't fit well together.  She got bored very fast and ended up mostly in the trash because she couldn't find all the pieces.  I would not recommend this for any child.
really cute. and some of them you can stick  on your pencil. and I adore them.
Bought 2 of these for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loves them.....best gift she got!!!
Love it
"For the price, these little guys are a great deal!! We ordered 2 packs and each one was different. There weren't any duplicates between the 2 packs and there were actually 3 'super rare' characters in the secret packs. My daughter was THRILLED!!"
grand daughter loved these
My granddaughter loved it for her birthday.
"My daughter loved this as a Christmas present. The pieces are tiny, but well made and very cute."
nice
"My 9 yr old daughter loved getting this for Christmas, all her friends have and collect them.  All the rage, apparently, but holy smokes these things should NOT cost what they do.  And, you really can't ""play"" with them, just collect n such."
Says styles may vary but got two of same sets.
My little neighbor lived them. The price was much better than you could find locally!
great
"good overall, had a tear in the board, but besides that all good"
"Basic stuff here. Not fancy. The dice are really small. I'd call them baby dice. Other than, all good."
Love this game..
Great
Good game!
It is very hard to find just an original Monopoly game anymore. This one was just what I was looking for and at such a great price I couldn't pass it up!
Great Value
It was not the original one that I thought I was going to get. It had a third dice? and the colors of the cards and properties were all wrong. It was hard to get into the swing of it but we finally did. The ad needs to say what type it is.
I like it
as always great game at a geat price
great product
"Monopoly is a lot of fun to play with family and friends, also the game can last quite awhile sometimes. This version does NOT have the moneybag but a cat instead. Also it has a new feature with a die that can change the game if you decide to use it."
"I bought this edition of Monopoly for the Children's Hospital LA gift drive.  It includes the new game piece, a little kitty!  Classic game.  Highly recommended."
My grandchildren love the game nice and sturdy just likeThe original board was. I would recommend this game again .
I like the game monopoly.  I would recommend this game to family and friends. This game is made very nicely.
"I wanted to have the old school version of the game and that's what I got. It also gives the option for a quick play game, which I have mixed feelings about, but I think that's mainly because I have always played the old, long way and it will just take more getting used to. I don't always want to play the long way and it's nice to have the option. It's growing on me."
"Works like a charm, just sit down with a few friends and you'll be sure to hate one of their guts by the end of the game.One issue though...The cat and dog are very similar in shape and size so invariably we would move the wrong piece and not notice until very long in the game essentially disqualifying the game. Not only are you mad your not winning, your ticked off someone has been moving the wrong piece around for the last 30 minutes.Alcohol may or may not have been a factor."
"cool game, everything's perfectly packed, the game is pretty interesting and fun. great idea to share time with family or friends!"
"I will definitely drive to the store for items like this.... I ordered five games and the quality of ALL five; CHEAP!!! The only decent pieces to the game are the 'character' pieces.  The cards came with LESS than 10 each, not to mention they are printed on paper practically!"
The game came in a well packed package and was in perfect condition!It is a gift so I have not opened it to find out if all the pieces are there.  I sure hope they are!I should have waited though and bought in store as I saw it was less money.
Good choice for any child that likes Shopkins. This pack of 12 was a good value for the money and the items are very cute.
Excellent
Great price compare to ToysRus and delivered straight to our doorstep. Order 2 and didn't get doubles which is a plus!Both pack came with at least 2 ultra rare and at least 1 Frozen Shopkins.
"Oh my goodness, my daughter plays with these little things for hours.  I wish I would've invented these!  So cute.  My daughter loves the ""surprise"" ones and collecting and trading for new ones with her friends.  We have to buy more and more until we have them ALL."
My grandchildren are very into trashies.
Loved it!
Awesome little toys!
"Good purchase, delivered quickly with the promised product."
great price
My 8 year old loves these.
I was very disappointed.  The Shopkins did not fit well and it sure does not look like $20 worth.  Would not recommend it to others
Great
My daughter loves shopkins can just in time
Thanks! My children and I enjoy the game!
"This was an order for my husband. He thought getting a gane with the new Cat Game piece was wrong. I saw the opportunity to get the new game.  We did not know, Monopoly now, does Auctions.  Cool."
My ten year old grand daughter loves this game.
"arrive on time, it is inexpensive and as fun as any monopoly."
Good
My six year old loves this game.
Great
all fine
It was just what I wanted. The traditional version
Better than I remember as a kid!
Great game but they need to put more hotel and house pieces in the box.
"I graduated from a Business Course that's why I love playing monopoly.I bought this Monopoly Board Game for my family.We play it during free time, when all the family members are present.This is always a great bonding moment for us.Of course, they can't beat me!I will always be the winner.Anyways, the quality of this product is superior."
Monopoly is such a classic game - every family should own it at some point!
Not enough currency.  We had to borrow from our old game.  But now we have all the game pieces that we lost!
"I bought this looking for the version of Monopoly that was closest to the version I had as a kid. This is pretty close. But I don't understand what they did with the tray. There are 7 denominations of bills, but unlike the old version, there are only five spaces in the tray for bills...and three of them have these strange humps in them so you can't put bills in them. I have no idea what the intention was with this, but it missed the mark. I'd rather have the old try back, please."
"This game is the original, the only difference is that it has a cat. This is great, it was my mission to find the original game, but without the cost."
Good quality!!! Just like old times!!
delivered in best condition and even better game.
My kids absolutely love these!
My daughter loves this but it's very easy to lose the characters since they are so small.
Great Christmas gift
This is not as shown it is 2 five pack with no big shopping basket as shown. You can get a true 12 pack from walmart for less than $10.00 dor be roped in by picture.
Wonderful
"Great Price, My Daughter loves her Shopkins."
my grandchild loved it small parts be careful!;
All packs were different. Nice because it was hard to find them in the stores at the time.
"What a drag...ordered this as a Christmas gift for my daughter and 2 of the packages were the exact same :(The description reads 12 pack but doesn't tell you the characters are duplicated, disappointed!"
It's monopoly! It's a great fun family game :)
"Comes in a big classic size box, but contains a cheap board folded in quarters. Everything is cheap. This is also a new edition with much different rules than when we were kids. Spend $10 extra for a quality made product."
YOU GET A CAT! yes a cat that can now chase the dog or vice versa. Its a great monopoly set. Much like the older ones but you get a cat :)
"It had everything that i wanted in a monopoly game, not to mention a cat game piece and an extra di for people who want to play the game a little differently."
"Bought as a gift.  My daughter and grandkids love it.  AND, the price is fantastic!"
Bought this for my daughter to learn how to count money.  It's a classic game.
Great game very adicting sooo much fun a great family table game
Great Game ! Good to play with friends and family.Not really feeling the new red die though. I dont really play with it.I never got a cat btw. I got all the tokens from the previous editions.
Good traditional game
Awesome!
Quick with a great price.
My daughter loves these!
Who knew these were going to be such a huge hit !! My 5 yr old daughter wants these like crazy !! but they are sold out Every where !! Thank the good lord I was able to order them Via Amazon !! once again Amazon saved the day not only was I able to order but they arrived ahead of schedule ! there is going to be one happy child on Christmas morning !!
As described.  Arrived on date stated.
xmas gift
I personally was surprised that my 7.5yr old asked for these. Seems that she should have grown out of things like this already. But she loved it! We use them as advent calendar stuffer--best ways to get her out of the bed in the morning!
Everything was great but it would be perfect if I can choose the sets.
"My grand daughter, who is 7, loves these and specifically asked for them for Christmas.  It's a great toy for older children, if you have younger children in the house I would not recommend this product as the pieces are very small.  The product was exactly as pictured and she will enjoy it very much.  Good service."
Purchased for my 6 year old who is crazy about these.  They arrived in a variety she did not have so that was an extra plus!
"We ordered this 12-pk for our granddaughter's birthday and I was very concerned to do so online as we could not see what she would be receiving -- although, as we knew she was 'into' Shopkins, we knew the basic concept.  She was thrilled with her set.  She even received one rare/limited Shopkin, which she had really wanted.  We ordered several Shopkins items, which Amazon fulfilled in one box, and per our daughter, there was a lot of squealing going on as everything was opened.  So, to be clear, the little figures are exactly as described and our just-turned-eight-year-old granddaughter loves them."
"Another good example of the classic board game. In my extended family, there are now five separate games, including Cars and Modern-era."
"Bought it for my 7 yr old. He is pretty excited with it. Its pretty educational for the kids too, as it teaches the value of trading and improves mathematical skills. In the world of video games, ipads and iphones this is a must have to keep kids away from the electronic world , at least for some time."
Exactly as it should be & a great value too!
Perfect gift
good quality all fronts
Monopoly is just one of those games that should be on the shelf in every families home for game night!
"Fun game, i had to buy cause i like this game so much"
it is a total timepass game and it can kill your time easily by going on and on continuously. Weekend timepass
"I am horribly offended that my iconic board game based on the greed and capitalism of this great nation, has, instead of $ symbols on the property cards, Malaysian Ringgit symbols. Sad, Sad, Sad"
"As a long-time Monopoly player, I wanted to share my love of the game with some of my students. I ordered a few of these for a tournament one weekend, and they were perfect! If you prefer using paper money to the credit cards in some versions of Monopoly, this one is a good choice. It contains all of the classic/original street names and houses/hotels."
"The rules of Monopoly, as far as I know, are passed down from generation to generation.  Different tribes of peoples speak of different laws governing the play mechanics.  I, personally, come from the ""Pay All Fines To The Center Of The Board and Collect Them When You Land On Free Parking"" tribe.  In addition, I relish in the pain that comes from non-math oriented players attempting to determine how much of their hard earned (read collected on free parking) monies they have to pay when they land on Luxury Tax or pick Street Repairs from the deck.This version destroys everything I held sacred in my tribe's worship of Monopoly.  My 9 and 11 year-olds shout ""No! That is not in the rules...the rules clearly state, blah blah blah"".  And they then point them out, printed ever so helpfully, on the little card-board insert that keeps the pieces organized when packed away.  Damn you Hasbro, first D&D...now Monopoly...simply shameful.For those who want to know how Hasbro has ""ruined"" this classic:1) You now play with Monopoly money (it even has a new M symbol instead of the correct $ one)2) All those % calculations that I loved to watch drive players insane and bring the game to a screeching halt...gone3) Better graphics and more durable cards...what was wrong with felt?4) Smaller dice (so now the 6 year old can play...wtf!?!)6) Some bastardized red die that can be used to play a faster version...FASTER VERSION?!?!? Monopoly should last HOURS...nay DAYS!7) Printed rules both inside the game box AND in the easily hidden/destroyed/lost rules book.8) A !@#$%^ cat...seriously?!?!  The FIRST thing I did was make the little Scottie dog chase that flea-bitten, allergy inducing, adorable kitten all the way to Jail  (and not Just Visiting) This is simply NOT the game I remember...it quite possibly might be a totally different game...at least it is still fun :)"
"What can I say about Monopoly? It's Monopoly. The only thing I don't like is the ""cash drawer"" which has raised doohickeys in the center of 3 of the slots, making them impossible to use. WHO in the world thought THAT was clever?! Other than that, I'm enjoying it immensely!!! But then . . . . maybe that's because I keep winning. LOL!"
My kids love these things!
Very cute!
Just as described
I bought this for our seven year old granddaughter.  She will have hours of fun with it.
exactly as describe would buy from again!
Unreasonable prices for these love them but not a good price
My granddaughter selected this product....she was thrilled with it!
my kids love them
It's cheaper than toy's r s and the same
really cute!!
Gave it to my 12 year old as a replacement for one he wore out (and lost a few pieces). He loves the game and the new piece - CAT.
Hard not to love an old classic!  We have had a rough winter and it is a game we can put away and easily return to for later play.
Monopoly continues to be wonderful fun.  I'm enjoying playing the same game with my grandchildren that I enjoyed playing ad a child.
"This is different from the original monopoly, its small which doesn't give you enough spaces to put money in the bank. The board is cut weird and didn't lay flat nor unfolded even. I love monopoly but this specific edition isn't great."
"I played Monopoly for many years as a child with my parents & grandparents. I bought this with the same idea for my grandchildren(who live with me).. Was an excellent idea!!! They are 10 & 12, this is helping them with spending, counting larger monetary bills & learning how to make & count change back..we have had many ""productive hours"" already!!!"
"They've added the cat but that isn't anything to get excited about. But adding the red die and $1000 more starting money for each player into the game makes Monopoly more entertaining. It speeds up play. You go around the board faster. It adds more decision-making and that makes the game more interesting. The red die makes Monopoly better for two people playing the game. Conceivably, two people could play two games in an evening; not all that easy if playing in the classic, two-die, $1500 each approach."
This is the newest version of this iconic game.  My grandchildren spent hours playing this over the holidays.  It was a hit!
Never been disappointed with a monopoly game. Love the extra game piece.
Of corse this is a great game. it is a old time favorite. I purchaced it for my Daughter for Christmas. She wanted it so that we could take it to the mountains with us to play : )
"So cute! 12 shopkins, four small bags, and a large basket!"
"Shopkins, Shopkiiiiiiins! My kids love these."
My child enjoys collecting shopkins and opening the blind bags. Great product.
"LOVE, LOVE THEM FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTERS!!!"
My daughter loves these things. She was very happy with them.
Great!
"All the rage, get them while you can!"
MY LITTLE GIRL LOVES THEM!!!
The girls love these but they were very expensive to bad stores which are advertising these don't really have them
Kid loves it
My grandson asked for monopoly for Christmas! It came on time and he was so happy with it. We had to play right away!
"Overall all great game as always, and the new cat is a great addition. However there were a couple changes that I wasn't very fond of: 1. Luxury tax is an even $100 not $75.2. Poperty tax peice (4th spot after GO) no longer provides the option of paying 10%. I understand that after you own a couple properties the $200 is the easiest to pay. But on a first roll, paying 150 instead of 200 is preferred. While I know I can choose to keep playing as if the 10% option were there, my family is very ""by the rules"" type of people. If it doesn't say you can do it, then you can't.3. Less individual bills given. Instead of the traditional 5- $1's, 5-$5's, 5-10""s, 6-20's, 2-50's, 2-100's, 2-500's you now only get5-1's, 1-5, 5-10's, 2-20's, 2-50, 3-100's, 2-500's. I know either way it's still 1,500 at the start. but it leaves you feeling more broke than you are when you are holding your money in your hand."
"My 5 year old loves shopkins so we've bought lots of them. I just don't like how the price is constantly fluctuating.  However, they are cute and my daughter can play with them for hours in all kinds of ways so it does stimulate the imagination as well."
My daughter had been begging for these so they will go in her christmas stocking this year. They shipped fast and came in exactly as pictured.
Great Game.  I enjoy playing this as a family when we have company over.  hours of fun and competition with others
This is very addictive and I love it. it was fun to play with friends and family members. I will buy it again and recommend this product to anyone.
"That is the question I have been asking myself over many board games of the past. These boardgames went pretty much unchanged for 30+ years but suddenly Hasbro and others have decided to either dumb-down or cheapen an already simple product. Monopoly is one of those games that luckily hasn't experienced much ""change"" as far as the design and gameplay is concerned but for the price I'm really disappointed with the quality.The board itself is the biggest complaint because it folds in four and its creases and cut lines don't exactly leave a flat surface. Plus the printed side looks very low-quality. I also don't understand the design of the money slots. You can't lay the money flat.Nostalgia is a big thing for board games and I know I played a lot of them back in my younger years. Obviously they fall apart with heavy use, missing pieces, or just because they've been thrown out so we look to replace them. Unfortunately these newer sets don't look like they will hold up to minimal use let alone as something you can keep around for as long as your previous versions."
"Everything is there as advertised but the board (which folds into fourths) isn't engineered correctly. It folds fine but when you open it up, the sides where the board is not connected do not line up. There is a reasonably large (and annoying) gap between the sides. It's not a huge deal and I need the game for this weekend so I won't be sending it back but I didn't pay $20 for a faulty product."
love it
The has been a favorite of mine since I was a child. I was excited to find this one at half the cost of others. I was annoyed they changed some of the colors on the game only because I liked the original.
"Bought this as a present for a friend's child. I loved playing this game when I used to have more time on my hands, now I'm happy that I was able to pass this on to the next generation!"
I wanted to teach about real estate to my kids and they get excited with the way they can see their asset build up.
"I got what i expected nothing more nothing less, also like the 3rd dice good wau to speed things up"
Its monopoly... what else can you expect. Love this game. nice to play with friends and family. Nice to play during snow storms
Grandaughter loves them
A gift for my daughter.  She is a future cat lady and mostly was interested in the dog but as at the very least has gotten her interested in playing this great game.
What is not to like about Monopoly?  Doesn't everybody absolutely love this game?  Who hasn't played it a million times?
Love it
How can anyone give Monopoly anything but 5 stars.  It was around for me to play as a child and now at 73 it's still a great game.
Great for the kids to make up there own little games
Grand daughter loved them
great product
"This is a timeless game that I played with as a child and wanted my daughter to be able to play it as well. It arrived on the delivery date. Which I love. I like to know when I'm getting an item to be home. It was packaged alittle flimsy but still durable enough. I was pleased to see the parts of this game weren't at all what other reviewers have mentioned. It's durability is very nice. The game pieces are well made and the best part, the cat piece is an awesome way to spruce up an older game. I love it. I recommend it!!"
My kids love this game they play it often. It was shipped in a timely manor and my kids enjoyed it for the holiday.
"Classic game. Kids love to count their ""money"", budget their $$$. Great fun for whole family, also learns real life situation. Highly recommended."
"I had ordered this to have as a game to play over the holidays.  But with everyone's hectic schedules, we never got around to it and it somehow got mixed in with other's Christmas gifts, so I guess I will be ordering this once again.  lol"
It takes to long to set up and costs $4.99 on app store. It is fun to play with but trading with thecomputer is not fun.I rate it at 4 because I like it! 4 because
It replaced an English version which I have had for 50 years. Getting used to the new property names. thank you.
"Game was fun and included all the parts of your typical Monopoly game! Includes game board, fake money, game pieces, houses & hotels and more!!!"
"The money slots don't work right. This is VERY annoying while playing. I like the board folding in half rather than in 4ths. The new cat I could care less about. But, it still plays the same."
This item was as expected. It is being used on game night and as expected last longer than most :)
Classic game great gift when win-win win-win awesome gift bill over the same android goon mart bet no more if
"Bopught this updated old version for my granddaughter, at my daughter's suggestion. The granddaughter played it the first day, with her Dad, but they quit as it took too much time."
I got it for my grandkids. I loved playing it when I was a kid! Love the new cat too!
really cute toy.
Amazing price and arrived on time
I bought 2 12 packs and was disappointed. The first pack was opened and the other one has tape all around it. i dont recommend buying from this dealer.
"My daughter loves playing with these. By themselves, with Barbies, Ponies, Pet Shops, etc! Perfect little toy for kids with great imaginations :D"
"Shopkins are sooo cute!The sets are all different, so there's no way to review exactly what you'll get, but each set has 10 that are viewable through the packaging (including, in this series, one special edition frozen Shopkins), two mystery Shopkins in little yellow bags, four flexible plastic shopping bags, and one hard plastic shopping basket. The set also comes with a checklist, where you can see the names of the characters and how easy it is to find them (common, rare, ultra rare, or special edition). The bags and basket are big enough to hold all the Shopkins in the set. If you've never seen them before, each one is about 1"" high.A neat extra touch to them is that a lot of them (10 out of 12 in the set I purchased) have a hole in the base so that they can be used as pencil toppers.The attached video shows the ones that I got in the set. Though this will vary, I hope it will just give you a representational view of what comes in a set."
good product
"My daughter is nuts for these things. I think they're cute, but they can be pricey. At the toy store, they're going for $3 for two, so this is a great deal.Will make a nice stocking stuffer."
Great collectable Shopkins play set.  Kids love them and mine were no exception.  Not recommended for anyone under 4 or 5 based on their small size.
I have had a great time playing this game with my two granddaughters. This game never grows old through time.
"That's not what I want to buy, very different! regretful"
These are so cute!!!  My daughter loves them. good quality. we received the item promptly.
Can't wait to give these to them for Christmas
This is just a medium level monopoly game board. I bought it with so much believe its going to be really good. I gave it a 3 star because I see its just a medium level board. its not that outstanding as claimed.
Good deal for the money!!!!  Arrived on time....safe condition.  Super cute selection!!!!!!
"I haven't played this in years and was so excited to get one with the new cat piece.  haven't played yet, but though it is different it is still a game I love!! Go Monopoly!!!"
"The board quality is a little lower, but the price definitely makes up for it. It plays a great game just the same. The speed die isn't as fun, but its only an option. It still includes the original rules."
"Every game of Monopoly I have ever played has ended the same way, everyone quitting because the game drags out to the point that no one cares about winning anymore. This game is a dinosaur that should have gone extinct 50 years ago. If you want to play a good board game that's easy enough to play with families, check out Ticket to Ride or Settlers of Catan."
"This package of Shopkins was a super pack!  The price and everything you get iin it is a super deal!! My granddaughter Natilyn went on and on how happy she was when she received her Shopkins!!  She can't wait to start playing with them!! This is the first time I got baskets with my Shopkins before Nana!!!  So,  the baskets were a big hit!!  Shopkins are new to me but she shares them with me when she visits us one weekend.  I was impressed that this product encourages children to use their imagination.  I think this is important because our children today are on TV and geared to computers and electronics very early these days.  Children are not encouraged to be or allowed to be children.  It's good to encourage children to use their imaginations.  Natilyn played with her 10 Shopkins for awhile with me and shared their names.  She showed me how she played with them by herself and we played together.  These Shopkins are small in size and would not be good for toddlers.  Kindergarten and up. Children that know not to put  things in their mouths ."
Ordered 2 of these. You are only able to see 10 of the shopkins 2 are surprise. In one package 8 out of the 10 are new ones my daughter doesn't have. In the other my daughter has all 10.. so yes ordering online is a total surprise.  But my daughter will be happy no matter what. She has many doubles or even 3-5 of the same one.. it is part of the surprise factor. So if you get mad when you get doubles I would say do not buy the 5 or 12 packs online go to the store and get them. Also you can only order 2 packs and when you try to do another order it won't let you. Guess I have to go search for more packs at toys r us and target and possibly justice. Christmas is fast approaching don't wait till closer to christmas these are a hot item this year
Love it!!
She loved it.
"Once you shop, you cant stop! Oh my, my daughter loves this little shopkins and would want to collect all!"
Excellent product
"This game came wrapped & sealed, all pieces were inside as expected. We had a great time playing this classic game."
"We were told to expect delivery no sooner than the 15th of July and they arrived yesterday on the 10th!  Yay!  My grand daughter was hoping a Cheese would be in the one she got as it is pictured here, but no cheese.  Description says ""styles will vary"" so no fault of the seller.  We just can't find either the yellow or the blue cheese anywhere, so were a little disappointed.  I hadn't read that part of the description 'til just now so we were expecting to get Chee Zee in our pack.  Hope we can find a Cheese Shopkin SOON!"
Perfect for the kids.  They have tried to buy them at target on 2 separate trips and they are always out of stock.
I love it 5 stars tops!!!
My little girl loves these and we are addicted! We got ours at Target for $9.99. This pack is not worth $20!
Totally happy
Fun party game.  Got extra used head bands to add more people to our game group
"my friends and I didn't like the game as much as we thought we would.  the product itself was in good condition, no problem"
FUN game for adults and children !!
fun
"I don't really get the obsession with these, but my 5 year old collects them and loves them to pieces."
"Good price,  great product!!!"
We had a lot of laughs playing this one.
My daughter loves them!!!
fun. not a drinking game. takes some thought on the objects
"These things are super popular right now.Very hard to find also. The toy store displays for these things are always ransacked. This was a gift and they were very excited. Apparently, there was an extra special super duper rare Shopkin inside. Whatever that means,lol."
"This is a fun game.  We changed the rules a bit.  We used teams and instead of the person with the card asking questions on Who, what he or she might be, the people on the team must pantomime what the name on the card is, it's a lot of fun that way."
Grand daughter loved them
Everything I expected.
I was pleased with this item. I ordered it for my granddaughter who loves shopkins. She was very pleased with this item.
"Not sure why it's the ""adult version"".. Nothing very crazy or adult on the cards. Just a little harder than basic kids things."
My 6 yr old granddaughter loved it
Delivered on time. Ordered four and rcvd four different packs as advertised .
my grand-daughter loves these .. will be ordering more
Great birthday gift.
I use this game in speech therapy. I was afraid the older kids would think it silly to wear the band. They love it! I will use the cards that came with the game and also create cards with pictures of things and people in their communities. Very useful tool.
how can you go wrong with monopoly its been around for years. As a family I played this since I was a small boy and continue to play this with my kids.
New style on a classic game that we all played growing up. On first glance it looks fun. We will be opening it up this evening and breaking it in. It really is a can't miss!
This game is good. I slightly overpaid for the game to get free shipping but the game is fun to play in its classic form.
"This was purchased as a gift for my daughter. We will have hours of fun with it, I am sure."
Just what I expected. How could I go wrong with prompt delivery on a classic board game?  I made a good choice.
"Original monopoly game, all the pieces are the same and its a good set and you cant beat the price!"
"This game is really fun and its for the whole family. So, its really good for holidays and family time."
I guess I was expecting the same quality of construction that board games had when I was a child.  The cardboard is much thinner and the playing pieces don't have much weight to them.  I think we will have to be very careful with this set to keep it in good shape.
"I bought these for my 5year old for her birthday, because she saw them on tv. She never played with them once opened, however, my almost 3 yr old plays with them constantly. If you are confidently past the toys in mouth stage, I would recommend this for 3-4 yr olds."
i like this item because they are cute to collet and to sell.they are have cute little faces on them.even though they are hard to find i still LOVE them.thank you Mosse toys for making these
Very good package. Highly recommended.
Shipped as promised.
"My daughter just loved this item, was very excited by it."
Quick delivery - as described!
Requested and loved by my 7 year-old granddaughter.
On time and what we expect!
Delivery terrible and paid for quickest delivery.
My daughter absolutely loves these Shopkins but they are not the easiest to find. Very cute!
Game was a little over priced then what I had seen it for at the stores! Whish I would have not bought it on amazon! If only their returns were easier!
it was great fun!! liked every detail of it. Got to enjoy it with friends and family although they were bored with the product later on.
"Best Ever! Wow I Love this game. it has a black cat, i just love it. its one of my favorite games"
"The board folds over with a slit on one side to enable it to become even smaller. I prefer that it would not be slit and would have simply folded in two. Otherwise, it seems great. We haven't played it yet but I can not find fault with it , otherwise. It was a good price for around $10."
"Reminds me of being a kid. This was a brand new board sealed in plastic, exactly what I was looking for."
This is a cheap piece of garbage. The cards are on cheap stock and were cut at the wrong place so that each card has part of the next card on them.  Amazon - i've never gotten such cheap garbage from you before. You will want to investigate this seller... I do NOT believe this is Hasbro - must be counterfeit?I don't believe this is going to last us very long and is not worth what we paid for it. My son wanted to play it right away so I'm not even sure we can return it since we opened all the packaging.
well packaged. Game is new and still in the plastic.  Giving it as a gift to hubby.Can't wait to play!
It was a present for my 11 yr.old granddaughter.  When she took the board out of the box and opened it up to place it on the table to play the game....the board split in half.  We had to use an old board that we already had to play the game.It is a cheap product...not like the Parker Bros. product of the past.
The board was broken when we received it. How ever it didn't hinder the ability for us to use it.
I received the Monopoly game in timely manner and in perfect condition. This version of the game is great for most families. I recommend the game and seller.
Granddaughter enjoyed these very much if they make her happy they make me happy.
As described fast shipping
Granddaughter was extremely happy!
Ordered these for my girls and they totally love them. I even enjoyed looking on the chart for their names and marking them off. Will be buying more soon. Fast shipping too.
It was exactly what my daughter wanted!
I got all the ones that I wanted
These were not the shopkins that we received;( wish I would have known. My daughter was so disappointed .
More than I thought it was love it
Sadly overpriced.
Very good with respect to the price. The quality is reasonable. I like the British version and it is US version.
"Monopoly is super fun and this edition includes the new cat piece. It is a bit changed from the original, incredibly slight things, like they use a different symbol for money instead of $, it looks like the Yen symbol (ya know the Y with line thru it) but it's an M with a line thru. Otherwise, what's not to love about Monopoly?"
"Well, it's a monopoly! However I'm not use to the new token (the cat), but it has the same classic view.The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the quality, which is not as good as it used to be before. I had one 6 years ago, and leave it for a friend, and has quite a better quality than this."
"Good solid build, this game is great to get the family together and with the new speed rules it makes the game a lot quicker and playable for short periods of times"
"I bought this as a gift for my 21 year old.  I didn't want her to forget her childhood and the things she loved.  She always wanted the dog and then asked why there was no cat.. So that is the only reason I bought it, so she could have her cat.  But the quality of the material is typical for this day and age."
"It's a game of monopoly. There's really not much to say. Monopoly hasn't changed much since I first played it.A few comments:-The cat playing piece is adorable.-The property cards are now the same size as Chance and Community Chest cards. I don't know how I feel about this.-The speed die is gross. Don't use it. Monopoly games are SUPPOSED to be really long.(Also, monopoly being educational? Puh-lease. I cheat religiously at this game. Then again, I guess it is an effective demonstration of capitalism. :]  )"
This is one of my favorite games since i was a kid still love to play it so much fun.
"Chances are that you've already played Monopoly once or twice in your life, so I'll skip most of the well known details such as it's a great game for 4 or more players both old and young. Anyways the quality of the board and game pieces are about the same as previously released Monopoly boxes. The only big differences are the new cat token and the speed die as well as new rules related to it. My guess is that the speed die was introduced since the most common complaint about Monopoly is that the game takes too long to finish. However you really don't need the speed die if you played using the official rules involving property auctions. Specifically, if a player lands on property and fails to buy it, that property immediately goes to public auction for all the players to bid on with a minimum starting bid price that is way below the normal property selling price. This makes the game finish much faster.Personally, I find it more enjoyable to play the themed versions of Monopoly though they tend to cost more (even though most of the time, the rules are the same and the differences are just cosmetic):Monopoly: South Park Collector's EditionFuturama Monopoly Collector's EditionMonopoly The Simpsons EditionSpongeBob Squarepants Edition MonopolyMonopoly Hello KittyMonopoly Family GuyStar Wars The Clone Wars MonopolyIf you can find them and you like playing Monopoly a lot, the better quality sets are better as well. They have nicer looking and more durable game pieces. Of course, they cost more as well."
Bought this for my niece's 5th birthday and she loves it!
very good
"The key to buying Shopkins on Amazon is to make sure you're buying them from Amazon and not a secondary seller. I recommend wish-listing the packages you would like to purchase and checking that list occasionally to see when the price has dropped to what the actual retail price is (in this case, this one retails for $12.99).My daughter fell in love with these because she saw them in a YouTube video so naturally unlike when I tried to convince her to get them back in the spring when they were available everywhere now everyone is reselling them at double what they retail for. But I got lucky and used the method above and caught them when Amazon had them in stock at their warehouse.I wasn't sure whether I'd think they were worth the wait but these are really cute and if your young child likes tiny things to play with as mine does these are just the right size. In terms of collecting them... I don't intend to focus on them as a collectible but I was happy to see that we got 2 of the Ultra Rares in our surprise package part of this set. I will definitely be looking to repurchase this pack again when it's back in stock with Amazon.UPDATE: Caught this at $9.99 sold by Amazon this past week so I ordered 2 for the upcoming gift giving season. Keep watching this item, the regular retail price does happen!UPDATE #2: I caught these as low as $8 sold by Amazon and the Season 2 Shopkins are supposedly starting to hit stores so watch out for those resellers trying to gouge you at double the retail for those."
Kids were very happy
A+
Bought these at the request of grandchildren.  They loved the toy and getting something delivered to them.
Awesome!
"My daughter loves these, just wish they were easier to find in stores :)"
These are so cute my daughter is so happy with them.
Glad to be able to order and get what I want and get it quickly.
"Shopkins was order for my 13 year old granddaughter, she is starting to collect these Shopkins Toy.  She is very happy and always checking for Shopkins in amazon."
I dunno why these little things are so high in demand but my daughter loves them
Kids enjoy playing with them
"My cousin loves it! She is asking for more, I'll definitely get more for her!"
"my daughter loves them, I have no idea, just toys for my baby girl. But she values them very much"
delivered earlier than i expected. my daughter loves them.
I want one of  Hopkins toy 12 pack
Daughter loves drawing and coloring in this. Easy to understand for 6 year old. would reccommend this product to anyone.
Great
My four year old daughter absolutely loves this!  It's very well constructed and has lots of templates and stickers to dress up the dolly figures.  She plays with it for hours on end.
Item is durable and daughter loves it.  It is small like Polly Pockets.but.seems to withstand little hands and breakage better.
There are a few other stencil fashion type drawing portfolio's out there but if you have a Lalaloopsy lover this is the one to buy!  I loved the shape of it and the cute crayons that came with it.  Those little details make it just a little bit more fun for the little artists :)
The 3 year old I purchased it for was very excited and eager to begin her play.  The stickers were so good for dexterity and eye hand coordination.
Absolutely loved by the  four year old girl child that wanted it and also by her seven year old  brother who likes to draw.
"The crayons that come with the book aren't the greatest and colour very lightly. Two broke quickly. Otherwise the book is cute and has lots of stencils, best used with your own markers or pencil crayons."
"My 7 year old is bored with coloring books.....so this was perfect, she felt more in control, she felt like a older girl."
"This is a great item for travel of one day, it could last longer but my daughter went through the pages fast and once thats done there's nothing left but the crayons and stencil's.Would have gave it 5 stars if price was cheaper, but she loved it and it kept her busy for hours."
Super cute and exactly what I was looking for
Love that there is a girl pirate now to go with the boy pirate. # lalaloopsy insiders
Great!
Thank you so much! It's lovely!
perfect
Good
We bought 2 cars - one for each daughter.The controllers operate both cars so the girls can't even play in the same room or their radio signals overlap each other.The cars work great - but don't buy two. :)
Got this for my 4 year old granddaughter.  When she saw it her eyes lit up lite a christmas tree.  So much fun with these lalaloopsy toys.  I also got her the sew perfect playhouse.  hours of fun. Just the right size for grandmas house and her little fingers.  How cute. Even our dog loves running after the car.
My lil girl loves these little dolls. will be ordering more for her birthday! Thank you for the wonderful gift
Bought for my niece for her 5th birthday. She loved it and all the other girls loved it too. Very cute
These toys are a big hit with little girls. The only downfall is they don't have a lot of accessories to go with them. Hopefully that will change soon.
"Grandaughter had searched for this doll , because she has a cat. She is putting together her dolls for the large Lalaloopsy house, and this was a treasure to her."
My granddaughter loved this doll. She wants to get more of them and start a collection. I would recommend these dolls for all girls under 10 years of age.
Little girl's love pink and my great-grandchildren are no exception. Hopefully the prices will come down on the La La Loopsy dolls.
I bought this toy for my daughter who loves Lalaloopsy toys. They have lots of fun using their imaginations with these toys.
"This was a cute toy and delighted my granddaughter, but it was purchased as an accessory for the ferris wheel.  It didn't fit inside the seats."
"This toy is very cute but I was dissapointed by the size, very tiny. I should have read the information better instead of assuming that it would be medium sized because of the price."
My daughter loved these cute dolls in her stocking!  They are actually higher quality in person than I expected.  Thanks!
So cute. I love the little squirrel but he's so little. The pieces are getting lost all the time. Need a box.
"Couldn't be better, absolutely no problems, great doing business with Amazon. This is a great toy for 3,4, and 5'yr olds.  They seem to go just about every where.  Ok to take out to dinner with more adults around.  Keeps the little's happy and busy before being served.  such a great toy.  Thanks"
"It was the perfect gift for my little girl as a part of her collection.Lalaloopsies are well made, nice material and durable dolls. I like this kind of dolls for my girls"
My 4 year old grand daughter loves these and I've bought her many. I don't know what it is about these little dolls but I think they are adorable. My grand daughter plays with them for hours and hours.
This is my daughter's favorite of the mini lalaloopsy dolls...she plays with this one almost daily.  So cute!  Great for imaginative play.
"I love these dolls.  They are the cutest things.  I bought them as collectibles, so I won't be playing with them."
Adding this to our unboxed collection. Arrived quickly and in good condition. Now we just need a high shelf to display her.
Very cute and fun for my grand daughter. Easy to transport since its small enough to play w/in vehicle or away from the house.
Very cute toy! Received item before Christmas. Niece loved it a lot. Purchased other characters with it. Comes with small parts so Not recommended for child who likes to put little toys in their mouth.
LOVE TO PLAY WITH THEM THEY MAKE ENJOYABLE  TIME TO PLAY WITH PLAYS FOR HOURS EVERYONE DOLL IS SPECIAL  TO HER
"nice doll.  no problems just hard to get all the stuff out of the box.  they over wrap the items,."
This was a perfect addition to all of the houses and the fun house wih the roller coaster. The animal that comes with it is small so not something I'd get for a small child. This toys is super cute and very durable!
Went I see her face went she open her present no word can explain her satisfaction. She love her Lalaloopsy
"Came pretty beat up but it's a cute book, just wish it looked better since it's for Easter."
Bought this for a long plane journey for my 4 year old. It's a nice idea and she was instantly excited by it BUT the felt pens contained ran dry within minutes of her starting coloring and therefore we couldn't use it until we returned home and used our own pens. It was really frustrating as the rest of the idea is well executed - I would have happily paid a little more to have better quality felt pens included.
We love this set except markers seem to be dried out before using
Very good for little girls good quality and good stickers
the ink in the colouring pen is dry!! my daughter couldn't use them!! but she loved the stickers and the drawings
What a fun activity book
"Bought as a gift for a creative niece and she loved it.  she got to ""work"" immediately.  How wonderful to give a gift that will make children create rather than continue to rely on technology for stimulation."
Great for travel and restaurants.  Children are impatient so we are always on the look out fir little things I can easily pack in a small bag and have on hand.  This has everything she needs to keep her entertained while we are in waiting mode.  I can whip it out at the doctors office or in the car.  The peace of an occupied child is well worth it.
"Ordered this for my niece's 4th birthday. She adores LaLaLoopsys and crafts, and this keeps her occupied for hours! I will definitely get her more when she finishes this one!"
"Lots of activities built into this little book -- stencils/tracing, stickers, coloring.  I wish there were similar kits for other characters!"
My 4 year old daughter loves this little book.  The stencils come out easily and the stickers are too cute.  It's a great little set for traveling and small enough to fit in her little backpack or my purse.
"Bright colors and so much to do - this is perfect if you are traveling with a kid, you can drive and the kid will be occupied for hours."
My four year-old (now five) loved these so I bought all three versions I was able to find on Amazon. She spent hours with these and even started to cut out the dolls after she colored them and used them kind of like paper dolls. This book alone honed her cutting skills in preschool until she was a whiz with a pair of scissors. Note: they're not intended for cutting out -- this is just an idea my daughter came up with and enjoyed. The books have great pictures of the Lalaloopsy dolls and pets to color and lots of fun stickers and tracing templates etc.
I had more girls in my class for a Christmas party and I was very lucky I could order the mini sketch books and receive them in time for our party.
Perfect for my 5 yr old who wanted to have sketch books like her older sister! Just enough detail for them to color.
"I bought four and gave them as Xmas gifts, it was very embarrassing that the markers didn't work.  Wouldn't buy again."
"My 3 1/2 year old loves to spend time painting and sketching with this. I bought it for a long plane ride and she is still using it, great buy."
this is a great item. we got this as an add on for a great price and our niece really loves it
"This is the third book of these that I've gotten (I have three little girls in a row).  They have, with each child, been a huge hit. What girl wouldn't want a book with a clasp to close it, a set of cute stickers, tracking papers and their very own marker set, all put in one cute little carry-able package?  My girls don't even know what Lalaloopsy is, and they still love it! I cannot imagine the squeals if you were big Lalaloopsy fans as well! Highly recommend!"
I bought this game for my daughter's birthday and she loves it!!! It seems like it's the only game my family wants to play right now so I'd say it was a good purchase! It's especially good with larger groups.
Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.Do compare to similar products and share how long you've used this product.Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort & fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your
"We're gonna run out of cards real quick and once you do, it's game over!  ha ha....Seriously though, I'm sure they have or will have expansion packs for this so don't worry too much.  It was REAL fun sometimes and not so fun others.  Depends on who you play with and how competitive they/you get.  Also, you probably will want to edit the rules for your situation.  We did two turns of the timer the first time and three after that.  For the price it's worth trying."
We love to play games and this was a lot of fun...especially if you like to laugh and have fun!
Gets you thinking really hard while everyone around you is having a good laugh. Great humour for the whole family. Need to know a lot about America though
It's actually harder to guess this adult leve than the junior level. I also bought the junior level for the kids and the adults use it more than the kids. Maybe when we get better at this game we can graduate to the adult version. haaa! We love board games so this game is a great addition to our library of games.
"So far, we have only played this once. With some serious and silly people.  It was not EASY to guess the words.  Others have advised the kids version would be better...perhaps they are correct.  We will try it again.  Has potential."
My family LOVES to play this...such a hoot for all ages.  I purchased the kids game for my nephew!  Can't wait to play with him and his sisters!!
"this game is great for all ages, kids can get most of the cards, some of the card are a bit tough for a 10 year old, but most ar good"
"A great game which can be played in an adult setting or a family atmosphere. Edge-of-your-seat fun. Everywhere I bring this game, it's a hit."
This game is a lot of fun!  It can sometimes be frustrating and challenging but you gain even more of a sense of accomplishment once you figure out that one little word that is stuck to your forehead.  It's a great family game.
"I bought this game for my family get together on New Year's Eve, great family fun! We all enjoyed it and it kept us laughing, this is one we will play again!"
"Gave this to my brother's family for Christmas. We had a great time with the game. I got the adult version (13 and up) since his youngest is already 12 (everyone else is 16 and older). We did have to pull out some cards that he may not know (popular culture icon that adults would know) and he did have trouble with some of them, but overall everyone else LOVED the game."
My friends and i have been playing this on the weekends.  The game will have you laughing at each other and you can learn alot about your friends/family way of thinking.  the reactions on peoples faces are priceless.  i would def. buy this again.  great for adults and kids.
Played this during the holidays with family & friends and we all had a great time! Would definitely recommend this game!
This game is a lot of fun. It doesn't matter if there are 2 people or more. It's very entertaining!
"HedBanz, Lot's of laughs and giggles associated with this game, fun for children as well as adults. We loved playing it."
"Wasn't sure which game to buy, but this one ended up being fun for everyone. Sometimes it can be difficult, so we just go around taking turns asking questions instead of doing rapid fire"
"This car only goes two directions: a) forward or b) backwards and spinning.  If you want to make it go anywhere in particular, you can't, at least not predictably and not without a huge amount of frustration.  The backwards and spinning action isn't even the same each time.  Sometimes it goes backwards quite a long way before spinning, and sometimes it spins immediately.I gave this to my daughter for her 6th birthday, after she really liked her little brother's Lightning McQueen RC vehicle, and she was polite but terribly disappointed with it.  She played with it for a few minutes twice, and hasn't really touched it since.  I had seen other RC vehicles marketed to girls (My Little Pony, Strawberry Shortcake) that have the same controls, but in looking at this one's remote I thought you could get it to go in 4 directions.  I should have looked closer! It seems that toy makers don't think little girls can or want to actually drive their cars with any purpose.  At least with the Lightning McQueen toy kids can learn to coordinate the remote with the car's motion.  Plus, the Lightning McQueen car goes over carpet very well and this one barely moves on carpet.My daughter briefly liked this when I told her it was taking her dolls on a ""crazy ride"".I am very disappointed in the gender disparity in RC vehicles. Perhaps this one is good for preschool girls but not for my 6-year-old."
"Bought her a couple months I to add to my little girl's huge collection of Lalaloopsy Dolls. She's not my favorite, but she's a cute doll and her colors are a nice contrast to the other dolls. I especially love her hair accessories."
"I would give this zero stars if I could.  My daughter is 4 and loves the other Lalaloopsy toys and books, so I figured this would be a hit.  The head is ridiculously heavy so it makes it awkward to carry.  I know they are supposed to be like rag dolls but there is no real reason for all of that weight.  Also the hair clips are cheaply made and come apart easily, so she got frustrated and lost interest.  An expensive toy that she maybe played with twice.  If you have a Lalaloopsy lover get them the little figures instead.  What a waste!"
Perfect
I got this for my little niece for Christmas and she loved it! She was already trying to talk me into getting her another one.
"Package arrived as described. My daughter has been collecting Lalaloopsy dolls since they came out, and over the years some clothes have been lost. This set works nicely so we don't have naked dolls!"
"My granddaughter is 4 and she love the Laloopsy dolls.. She loves combing their hair and styling it.  Also, she likes picking out the clothes for them.  ( I also got her a dress for the doll as well)  These are cute and reasonably easy to get on the dolls.  Once she got the clothes on, it was fine, but it took her just a bit the first time.  Really cute though."
"This raincoat worked pretty well, the sleeves are just a little tight so getting it over the loopsies hands is tricky, but my 5 year old figured it out so it is all good."
"I got this for my daughter's 4th birthday, I wanted to get her one for Christmas but they were all sold out then one of the top toys for Christmas that year, she loved it and it was orange and pink her favorite colors."
"Great item, good price, These clothes are hard to find in the toy store. It looks great on my Doll!"
"Cute doll but her head is very heavy.. My daughter wanted this doll for christmas last year but all stores was sold out. and i was not paying $80-90 for this doll (some ppl on ebay was selling it for that price (greedy) after doll was hard to find..so i waited until this year came on amazon and whaLA  i found the doll at a reasonable price..Amazon""s the BEST"
Bought this raincoat for my Grand Daughter .  She loved it!  This coat fits well and she was able to dress her doll without any help.  Nice colors and material.  would buy clothes again from amazon.  The price was good also.
My daughter LoVEd this doll! It has provided hours of fun and it is a great addition to her lalaloopsy family.
I purchased this doll as a gift for my niece. My sister told me my niece enjoyed this doll so much so much so that she has started collecting them.
Ordering was easy.Received Product very quickly!Neice was very happy with her Bea-Spelts-A Lot Doll!Overall - Satisfactory Experience!!
the products were well desinged and well made. i have no complains either with the manufacturing company nor with the shipping process
It is a great little doll.  Not as big as the full size one but just the right size to play with nonetheless.
small but cute. This is a christmas present for my niece. She will love playing with her new lalaloopy doll.
Lalaloopsy is very cute doll to play with. It's tiny but girls loved it.  Only thing is its bit pricy.
"Package was ripped but didn't have time to exchange, there was nothing wrong with the doll itself so I gifted it anyways."
"This was the fourth and final doll I needed in the ""globe"" box.  There were only four and now I have them all for my granddaughters birthday.  Arrived on time in perfect condition."
"Adorable!!!! Very cute set, but it's at Target for so much less! Prob can get it on Targets online store also"
"She asked for this specific doll for Christmas, and loved it! Each part is set into the plastic bubble and easily pops out after opening so there are no stray wires to untwist or ties to clip. Both of her legs swing freely and the head is respositionable, this surprised me, as I expected something more cheaply made."
Very cute but very expensive
"This was a nice doll. I just wish she could've had a more imaginative look, though, because both the girls' colors were very bland. Yes, yes! As I've been told (and read) many times, the sisters grew up in the jungle, but my daughter got bored very quickly with their uninteresting design. I do have to say though, I'm loving Kat's hairstyle! Darn it, why can't MY hair be like hers? ? Overall, this was a nice product."
Love them!
Dolls are beautiful and live up to advertisement promises.. We have started two collections and both little girls are excited and extremely happy recipients.
"I bought these for my granddaughter for Christmas.  She collects many of them and the selection just isn't in the local stores,Amazon has soooo very many to choose from.  I will continue to get them off Amazon rather going to the store and being disappointed that they don't have a good selection."
They are very cute and very well made and I have to say they are my favorite of my daughters dolls.
Exactly as pictured and described. Love that it has a big and smaller doll. Can't wait to give it to my daughter for Christmas!!!
"My 5 yr old Loves kitties, Love dressing up like kitties and has a leapard kitty costume. She also loves LaLaLoopsy Dolls so this really made her Birthday. She adores them. They are well made and will last for a long time. The only complaint I have of these dolls is their heads are top heavy so they won't even sit up by themselves. They made for great Imaginative play"
"My 4 year old daughter likes these dolls okay.  But I was really taken aback by the strong plasticky odor.  I hope it wears off after awhile.  Also, the heads are gigantic and surprisingly heavy compared to the bodies so these dolls don't sit up very well."
I bought these dolls for my boyfriend's little nieces (ages 4 and 6) and they were just delighted. They are very colorful and cute and seem very well-made. I am pleased with this line of toys and am happy to give them as gifts.
"My grandaughter loves this new set of Lalaloopsy dolls.It is her favorite set for christmas. The large house, furniture and the littles ."
"So sweet! We are new to LaLaLoopsys, and these were such a great start to our collection! My daughter carries the little sister around everywhere. Very well made, and a precious design."
the packaging was nice on this product and the service fast and and appropriate. Happy with the speed and quality of product.
"All 3 of my daughters enjoyed this. It was lots of fun for them. They are 10, 6, and 2. I was able to get one for each of them and e"
"If you have a lalaloopsy fan this is the perfect little additional gift. What kid doesn't like drawing, and crafts? This makes a great, affordable addition. It's nothing fancy, and just what it says. Tiny, but perfect to tote in a purse, or diaper bag."
"Ii saw this little gift and knew it was perfect for my daughter. Who LOVES to draw, but isn't quite confident to just freehand. The stencils can make it easier to draw a good picture. It comes with so many little details like stickers and markers and fun activity pages. It's small enough to slip in a purse. Adorable and versatile and sooo much fun!"
Is a huge hit with my almost 5 year old. Kept her busy for much of a 12 hr car ride!
"The markers included with the book are horrible! They were dried out and hardly worked when we got it brand new. Otherwise, the book is really cute if your child loves lalaloopsy. The stickers are really really small and hard to work for little fingers. But my daughter loves lalaloopsy so she didn't mind any of these problems and loves her little sketch book!"
Needed fillers for a birthday bag I through together for my daughter. She loved it and uses it often. The stencil that is included can be taken out and used for other paper. The markers weren't the best imo... started weakening after a couple weeks but that's no biggie. I have three kids- we have TONS of crayons and markers in our house.  It's small enough that my daughter can carry it around in one of her little tote bags. Would recommend!
"cute, tidy package. markers dry out quickly as others have said, but my bigger complaint is the stencils. there are stencils for different outfits, plus some hair accessories, and a ""blank doll.""  so i figured the stencils could be used on their own without the preprinted pages of the book.  however, for some reason the ""blank doll"" stencil is fatter than the preprinted dolls, and the stencil dresses only fit the skinny preprinted dolls.  the blank doll is too fat for most of the outfits.there is also no ""head"" stencil.yes, girls can just draw their own arms and legs and head in.  but, they could also just draw their own people with their own dresses, right?  if the publisher is going to make a set, why not make everything all fit?  why does the blank doll have to be too fat?  (and it's not fat, it's just more plump)  and why not just include a round head stencil so that younger ones don't get frustrated trying to draw a head that is just right so that the hairband stencils will fit?and, no, i am not a fat woman with issues.  i just think the stencils were poorly planned out."
My 5 year old granddaughter loves Lalaloopsy and she has enjoyed her little book.  Since its tiny it makes it easy for her to take with her wherever we go.
"Purchased for my seven year old grand-daughter, who is very much into fashion and drawing.  She has enjoyed it very much."
Easy to fit in my bag for nights in restaurants. My daughter was always drawing in little notebooks so now she has a purpose to her drawings.
"Bought this travel sized drawing kit for my 6 year-old while on the road.  Took it with us to our next stop (out to eat).  The markers were essentially useless.  They did not even last two drawings, which was a huge disappointment.  Would urge the manufacturer to take this into consideration.  Will not buy anything made by this company again."
"my granddaughter was very happy with this, she like lalaloopsy very much. i would difently order those again for her"
This book is good quality and has fun stencils. Markers are better than the crayon alternative. Cute size to easily bring along in the car or small toy bag.
"This is super cute and my 4 and 7 year old daughters can both do it without help. The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because the markers were dried out upon arrival. We fixed this by using out own, but it would be nice if the markers worked since there is a storage place for them in the book, making this perfect for travel."
"My grandaughter loves to sketch, and draw people and animals...I am giving her the little ""lalaloopsy Mini Sketch Book"" this Christmas because of it's completeness in providing everything she'll need to draw many colorful sketches...also she likes the color pink...lots of pink in this little book set!"
This is a fun family game.  You think that  it is going to be easy but it is very challenging.  Make sure you have plenty of time.  One game could take a while.
"I bought the adult version of HedBanz for my nephew (29) and the child's version for my great nephew (9) after reading the reviews on Amazon ( a must do before any purchase).  It was Christmas Eve and so we first played the child's version.  When I say ""we"", I mean eight family members, ages 6 to 74.  We had so much fun with the kids game we quickly moved to the adult version.  One thing I know about kids is this.  It's not necessarily the presents you give them that make them happy, it's the time ""you"" spend playing with them and the present.  Games bring people together and this one does exactly that.  My family is not gifted at holding meaningful conversation and entertaining each other.  HedBanz brought us together, gave us plenty of laughs and happy memories of our Christmas Celebration for 2012.  We didn't use the timer or follow the rules perfectly.  It didn't matter.  We were after ""fun"" and that's what we had.  Highly Recommend."
"My granddaughter wanted this game for Christmas.  She is ten years old, but the adult version is perfect for her.  It's a clever game for kids of all ages."
"We play this at least once a week and it never gets old. Even though the kids are younger, you can find words that they will not have trouble figuring out."
"I don't necessarily agree with the age rating for this game. We play with my 9 year old son, and have a blast! It has helped him tremendously with his deductive reasoning also :) Great family fun, or just great fun with friends. We laugh the entire game!"
This is a hilarious and entertaining family game. We played ages 10 - 50+! Even thought the box reccommends 14 and up. Great for parties
"Bought it as requested for our 14-year old granddaughter and have enjoyed playing it with her and other members of her family. Any time you can drag the kids away from the TV and computer, it's a good thing!"
LOVE LOVE LOVE thanks!!! Came on time and perfect time for a Christmas Gift for my daughter. I will deff use them again.
"Having played the kid version of this game, we already knew it was fun.  My daughter requested this for Christmas so she and her friends could add to her collection of game night."
"Had a blast playing this game. Is great fun for the whole family, children can play too. Makes them use their brains!"
"this game may seem silly and/or easy but it kept my family and friends playing for hours three nights in a row over the holidays.we laughed so hard it's exhausting - but in a good way!  it can be viewed as a competitive game but we found most of us were pulling for the other players to guess the ""secret word"".  the heck with keeping score!"
"This game is exciting! If you are thinking about buying, do it.  Can be difficult, but that's the fun.  A great game for those who want to exercise their minds and laugh a lot."
"My family loves to get together and play games around the holidays. It is a sort of tradition. My mom snagged this game for only 4 dollars at some local store.  What a deal! We all had a blast playing last night.It started off with each of us wearing a headband. Like others have said, they are easily adjustable, so they should fit anyone's head fine.  Then you slip a card into the notch without looking at it. Out of habit, several of us caught ourselves looking at our cards when putting them in and had to exchange them. No biggie though... There was a big stack to trade from. We also got three coins apiece to use.The tallest person goes first. They have a helpful card that suggest questions to ask. We frequently used this card! It starts with questions like 'Am I a person? Am I a place? Am I a thing? Do I have four legs?' We had cards like office, Johnny Depp (hard!), Marilyn Monroe, farm, chopsticks, and golf course.  That person has the amount of time from the sand timer until they have to stop asking questions. If they get it right before time is up, they switch cards and give a coin to the pile of coins. If they don't get it right, they keep trying on their next turn.  If the card is just too hard, they can get another coin and put their card back for another one. First person to run out of coins wins.There is a card you each get that tells you what answers you are allowed to answer. They are 'could be, yes, no, I don't know.'  There were a few disagreements in our game if one person had one thing in mind and another had another. Like for bank--- one person was thinking of the building. Another was thinking of a bank someone has on their dresser. When the person asked if this was in the house, one person said it could be and another said no. At that point you might clarify things to one another.Only suggestion I have for everyone is that you don't play with too many people. There were five of us playing. I think up to six are allowed.  Lots of times it got back to my turn, and I would have to start over asking questions because I would have forgotten where I was.  Usually everyone just reminded others,Very fun game. Provided lots of laughter for all of us... And it really makes you think!"
"It's fun with a group of people around a table. It has its moments where people keep asking the same questions, or are at a lose for new questions trying to figure out what / who they are. But, its fun,We all liked reverse charades, a few drinks, and lots of laughs"
My grandson got me hooked on the kids version...so I bought the adult version for camping...so much fun and laughs...only thing is around the campfire it's hard to see at night...we got up and walked around looking at everyones headbands ....but then decided flashing flashlights in everyone's face to read their card was much more comical. :)
"It's a neat game, but it doesn't seem like there's enough time to guess.By the time it gets back to your turn, you forgot the previous clues.Of course, you can adjust it to your needs, but we have a policy to follow the rules."
"The head is too big and heavy, though the hair is cute.  It's not the type of doll you cuddle up with or easily carry around if your a young child.  I bought it for my grand daughter, it didn't get much attention."
This doll is my 6 yr old daughter's favorite! She loves to style her hair and I love the fact that it is very durable. The price was great...bought at Amazon.
"This Lala raincoat is adorable, with yellow on yellow polka dots and pink gingham cuffs and collar.  The coat fits best by itself with no dress underneath.  The Velcro closures are on the front right seam of the coat, including one strip on the collar which attaches above the shoulder, and sometimes causes a small gap.  This does make the coat look nice from all angles (not having a Velcro strip down the back).  The yellow rain boots have pink buckles, pink soles, and blue socks sticking out of the top.The whole outfit looks great on all of my Lalaloopsy dolls, and I'm sure it would make any little girl happy on a rainy day, real or pretend."
"Seriously? How is this doll rated so high? All these dolls are very creepy looking, particularly at night! they are top heavy. The legs bend to sit, but the doll just falls over from the weight of its own head. The hair curls and straightens, like it says it is supposed to, but that is all it does.  it is durable though. My kid bangs it on the marble floor and she has not broke yet. For the price it is such a rip off."
"Cute doll! Excited to find this very hard to find Lalaloopsy little sis for my daughter! One negative- Doll box was bad condition, looked banged up & dirty....as well as was missing the special ""all about me"" trademark tag that comes tied with yarn on the handle of all the Lala dolls boxes (my daughter keeps them all). FORTUNATELY, the thick plastic protected the doll & she was just fine. However, if this had been bought as a gift to someone else, It would not have been in the ""new"" condition you want for a gift as the outside box matters more in that case."
I'm a hero to my twin grand daughters!!! Perfect size for 19 month olds.
"My daughter loves Lalaloopsies, and these minis are adorable. The smaller size makes them easier to handle (less heavy heads) and store."
"I ordered her to complete the set with her Big Sister Charlotte Charades and she is absolutely adorable! She was delivered fast. If you are unfamiliar with the  Lalaloopsy dolls, they are quite unique looking at first but once you see them in person they are strongly crafted and painted with such high quality that their paint DOESNT rub off or scratch off and their clothes are quite thick and sewn really well. Their large heads add to their cuteness. My girls are big fans. Beautiful dolls, priced awesome on Amazon. I would definitely recommend any of these dolls. By the way she is Charlotte Charades little sister NOT Kat's but I'm sure that was a typo. You can clearly see who she matches with."
I love the lalaloopsy littles- they are the perfect size for my toddler and I just think they are so wholesome and adorable! The details really made it special- the little croissant is just to die for!
"This is another cute doll from the Lalaloopsy littles line. Yes, the title is wrong, it isn't Kats little sister, but its no reason to rate the toy badly. Sherri is super cute, her little black hat does detach if you want to take it off.  My little ones have several lalaloopsy dolls, and our little Sherri's head was not too wobbly (which another reviewer said she received one that was).  The full size lalaloopsy dolls are heavier than most dolls, but the littles are not as heavy. Her outfit and mismatched shoes are adorable, and my girls just love her!"
Plan to give this to my daughter for a special occasion. It is so so cute !! These dolls are made extremely well and we are going to continue to collect the littles! Very happy with purchase.
This doll was given the wrong title.  Sherri Charades is Charlotte Charades' sister.  Kat's little sister is Whiskers Lion's Roar.
This doll's head is too loose/wobbly compared to other Lalaloopsy dolls. Could be just this one. I have bought others from Amazon and they did not have this issue.
"my grandniece went gaga over it and the colors fascinate her so much hat she loves to play with it all the time,"
"My 3 year old's new obsession are the Lalaloopsies and after seeing this set, my oldest has fallen hard as well. She is 10. My smallest claimed the little sister and my oldest claimed the other. The dolls are adorable. Their clothing is easily removable and my daughters found other clothing (Build a Bear, baby alive etc.) which fit these dolls. The dolls also come w two lions which we lost 1 of, already. I'm sure it'll turn up when we sweep under the couches. My daughters carry these dolls everywhere. They even sleep w them which is why I prefer the soft dolls. My youngest even used her doll as a weapon, when she cracked her sister clear across the head w it. So, I definitely prefer the soft dolls AND they're cheaper. But, this is, by far, the cutest two dolls of the bunch. A big hit with girls 3 and up."
"Delivered to me in a timely manner and no damage, great price. Thank you!!!"
just a perfect gift for girls who loves super heroes
Perfect!  The seller even threw in an extra little bracelt and pencil.  Very thoughtful and great purchase!
"It was great shipping and very quick. My Granddaughter is a very happy little girl. Thank you!! I did not see how it was package and has far I can tell my Daughter didn't complain about any of it and she took a picture with my granddaughter with her new ""baby"" my granddaughter loves lalaloopsy. I live in Texas my daughter lives in North Carolina. I had the seller ship it to her. No problems with the purchase."
My daughter really loves her. Even my boys thought she was a cool doll! I like it because there is a lil notch on each side of her head for the goggles to stay on. (A relief because I don't have to spend all day looking for them)  The box was really cute as well. The cape does feel kinda flimsy when you're putting it on and taking it off though. My daughter has had it for a month and it is still not broken  so maybe it's just me. But overall it was a big hit!
I bought this for my niece for Christmas & she absolutely LOVES it!!  Searches the stores high & low for her favorite character & this was the only one I could find!!  Made my 3 year old baby niece very happy!!Thank You!!
These dolls are resilient and my daughter who is 4 has dozens of them. We take them on trips in big ziploc bags and she can play with them for hours!
Kids loved the doll. Very nice addition to their collection. Cant find many of these in the stores now days
My daughter loves anything Lalaloopsy so of course this was a hit! She comes with little goggles and a little cape that both go on easily. The parts are so tiny that they're hard to keep track of but it's still a wonderful little doll. She has about 10 of these minis and loves every one of them!
As expected.
"the packaging was put together poorly, through the package the arm of the doll seemed to be pressed too hard where it already made a mark/dent on the plastic arm. The arm was delicate, so I knew  this could've posed a problem. I didn't want to make a big deal out of a small defect, so just decided to keep it. within 2 days, the arm feel out because there was already a deep cut  on the arm due to packaging. I ordered another doll which arrived at the same time and that one didn't have this issue.."
Came on time just before Xmas. Gift for my niece n she loves it! Very cute. There is small parts so not recommended if they like to put stuff in their mouths :-)
It is cute fir granddtgr
Delivered on time and is just like the one in the stores! It looks like they add an extra layer of plastic over the
"MUCH CHEAPER IN STORES AND ON WALMART AND TARGET.COM.  These dolls are simply adorable.  They are the perfect size, and I love that they come in different shades.  The only reason for three stars is because the painted hair and face wears away quickly after daily play. My girls have several Lalaloospy dolls and they all wear the same way.  My girls still enjoy playing with them, however, the company should find a way to make these dolls more durable and long lasting for the price."
"Excellent Babies, big huge hit with my grand daughter, best gift of the year!Excellent purchase, the outfit is beautiful. The fit is perfect !I don't have even one complaint!"
Daughter was thrilled with this toy.
Super cute to add to my granddaughter's collection.
Granddaughter love!
Really tiny but it's cute.  I often loose the mini lalaloopsy. But I'll find it in a week
it was a favorite gift. this little doll fits in your palm. was given to a 4 year old little girl who loved it
Love her
We have lots of Lalaloopsy dolls of various sizes but I don't really love this mini one.  The design is cute but the accessories are so small that they got lost really quickly which caused my daughter (age 4) to have a fit.  Honestly I think this is a better doll for a mom's office than a daughter's dollhouse...For a little girl I think the Lalaloopsy Girl collection is much more fun.
Excelente!
My baby girl loves her.
Just as expected ... we live the minis
great game
great
"Great game...really fun but agree with the other reviewers that it is indeed hard! There is a timer involved and I found it nearly impossible to ask the right questions to get a head start in the allotted time. However, it was loads of fun and all that played seemed to really enjoy the game. Great addition to game night."
Our family loves this game.  We have a blast with it.  I would recommend ordering it.
This is harder than it appears! LOL
Fun game
Great vacation game.  I always pack a few games that are light and easy to transport so that we have something to do should we encounter bad weather or travel delays.  We expanded on this by making our own cards.
"Great, great, great"
"Meh, not so much of an adult game as I thought it would be :/. Sort of fun! But not really"
You gotta play this for By great game night!
"I didn't end up giving this to my daughter for Christmas.  I was disappointed with it upon arrival.  It said ""mini"", but it was much smaller than I anticipated."
Love the holiday mini Loopsy dolls
Five stars
Adorable!
She Loved it!
Great product!!!
Great
Daughter really wants this one she doesn't know that it is hidden in the closet # lalaloopsy insiders
These things are just too adorable!
I think she's our favorite out of this fairly new line of minis -- super cute! Love her peppermint staff and purse!
"I got this for a get together of a bunch of college age friends.It ended up being a little harder than I thought it would be to play for the first time. The first few rounds we didn't have many people correctly guess the word on their ""bandz"". After a few rounds it became a little easier and everyone was able to ask better clue questions during the question round.This is one of those games that has a rocky start getting the feel of how it works then is fun for a few rounds and then gets a little old. We did enjoy playing and will probably play again, but I think we had more fun playing Apples to Apples Party Box - The Game of Hilarious Comparisons (Family Edition) when we got together last year."
"Arrived quickly, still sealed. Lots of fun because it doesn't get old. Along with this there are a large amount of cards. :)"
"Inglorious basterds card game in modern fashion. Try it out, worth playing at the bar or at home with the family."
I have played this game a lot with my grandkids and others.  At Thanksgiving we had a ball playing it with mixed ages.  I reccommend it for all ages.
Great game!  I forgot I had it and bouhgt it twice...and now I am giving it as a gift to someone for them to enjoy!
Hippity Hop! The Bunny Found it!...My daughter is only four away from the complete 2nd season!
Liked the color of the corn cute
"Adults and teens played this game Thanksgiving and all had a great time with lots of giggling and unbelievable clues.  We had played the kids' version before and had a great time with it but were ready for more ""serious"" play.  Would recommend for families and friends get togethers.  Actually more headbands would be great as everyone wanted to play!"
"The game is funny at first but you quickly realize that its actually quite difficult. Eventually the roaring laughter fades into chuckles and faint smiles. Rather than throw the game into the hallways closet of forgotten board games, we decided to make up our own rules. Instead of the player fishing for answers of yes or no, we made each player give a 'clue' to the person regarding their card. Someone had Tom Cruise so I started humming the Top Gun theme. Another had Las Vegas so someone said, ""A good place to lose an entire paycheck"". Eventually we paired into teams going at it for points which was even better. After the rule changes everyone had a great time. I encourage you to make you're own if you aren't already having a blast with the default game.""Fun Value"" aside, the game is pretty well put together. The headbands are solid and really hold the cards sturdy. The cards themselves are plentiful and diverse so you're always surprised at what they are.In summary, the limits of this game are those of your imagination.Have fun everyone.NOTE: The product image shows five 'headbanz' - There are actually six(As listed in the description)"
I've played this game several times with different groups and its always a 'blast' and soo funny watching others trying to figure out little petty words. Worth buying.
I have played the children's version with some family friends and loved the game and absolutely love the adult Version to play at home! Quick shipping! Great packaging! Fun/ enjoyable game to play on game night with family a d friends
Really fun game to play but be prepared to possibly have the same card stuck on your forehead during the entire game if you dont want to lose. This game certainly requires patience.
"Let's start by saying that this is a worthwhile investment. It's straightforward, fun, and reminiscent of some of the best college drinking games; though this is no drinking game. Players draw a card they aren't allowed to look at, place it on their headband so that other players can see it, then ask questions in an attempt to deduce what their card says.Playing by the box rules, the game is time-based. But you're likely to find that the timer doesn't allow anywhere near enough time for most players to guess their card correctly. What my crowd does is count the number of questions it takes each player to get the right answer, and you want to end up with the fewest amount of questions asked after a specific number of rounds; much like golf scoring. Adults could also easily incorporate rules making a drinking game of Hedbanz.There are tons of cards, and most of them are things the average person can guess. Occasionally though you'll find something which will stump the majority of individuals, no matter how many questions they ask; such as 'Queen Elizabeth 1'. We just allow players to skip the tough cards. The only other thing I would like to have seen here would be cards separated by category (person, place, thing, etc.). Aside from these minor complaints, this game is a great source of entertainment. Recommended to those looking for easily accessible fun, which requires next to no explanation of rules. Buy now!"
I gave my grandchildren the First edition of headband a couple of years ago.  They have had so much fun with it I decided to give them the 2nd edition.  Christmas night the whole family played.  It was even more fun watching the adults!  Looking forward to #3.
"Love this game! Fun for all ages, including adults! It's rare to find a game that we all can enjoy regardless of age."
bought this for my grandson.  He is really loving it.
"Super fun game, I love it. More difficult than the first edition though because there's less animals and food than in the previous one. Great family game and would recommend!"
"This is a simple product but fun.  The 4 of us played this 3 times over Christmas break - ages 16, 14, 51 and 50 and everyone enjoyed it...and it motivated us to look up a couple of things online.  Quick, lively and good photo op with the goofy headbands!"
"My kids are obsessed with Shopkins. They have over 100, and while I don't really see the point of them, they make my kids happy. They are a bit pricy in my opinion, but that may just be me, because they are always selling out. The stores around me get weekly shipments and they sell out within 2 days usually. One thing I like doing with my kids is having them sort the Shopkins by category. You can also throw in other educational games such as which ones would you wear, which get refrigerated, which can you eat, etc. these are a fun little toy to,use your imagination on."
I hate that these dang things are so impossible to find in the store but my 3 year old daughter just loves them so much. Glad to have found them on sale(ish) here for $5.99 that I bought two packs. They were different as well instead of the same shopkins which I was very nervous about but happy! I gave her one pack and am saving the other for Easter :)
"My granddaughter loves the Season 2 shopkins, they are more expensive since they are in demand, but worth the money!!"
Very good prodeuct
Packaged perfectly. Fast shipping. Fun for kids collecting them.
Both items I ordered were the exact same :(
"Great item , fast shipping !"
Fun little toys for kids....they hurt like hell when you step on them barefooted in a darkened hallway at 3 in the morning.
just what they wanted
Exactly what I was expectingfast deliverygreat job
I ordered these  for my daughter's ages  5 and  9. They loved them and got a nice variety of shopkins. A couple were repeat. But the rest were not.
terrific
My daughter and niece loves these
She loved it
Six year old is one happy camper.
These are adorable. My daughter loves Shopkins and even found an ultra rare character in her pack.
Kids were very happy and super fast shipping
My kids love collecting these! they are cute and don't fade or come apart. THEY ARE SMALL!!!! My three yr old collects them as well but she is very careful with them and does not put them in her mouth at all. ( I guess she wants to be just as responsible as her older sisters) I would not recommend them for young kids if they like putting things in there mouths cause these could easily be a choking hazard. That said they are fun to collect and trade.
"Mittens Fluff 'n' Stuff is adorable with her blue hair and darker skin tone than the other 3 Lalaloopsy Babies.  Love her and my other Lalaloopsy Baby, Jewel Sparkles,"
My 4 year old daughter wanted a Lalaloopsy baby SO bad. I decided on getting her this one. She loves it! Carries it everywhere with her.
My little girl saw the advertisement for this and she just had to have it. So we ordered it for Easter and she has yet put it down. It is now her very best friend!
this is the second Lalaloopsy baby I've gotten for my 2 year old. She absolutely loves them and they are really cute!
"Bought this adorable doll for my niece and she LOVES it. The doll is so soft that my niece is constantly cuddling with it. It was definitely worth the purchase, and I'd love to get the 3 other dolls! I love Lalaloopsy."
Big hit with granddaughters
"I bought this doll because my 5 year-old niece asked for it for Christmas and I can't wait to give it to her.  First, the doll is larger than I expected.  She's over 10 inches tall, with hair that makes her head nearly 9 inches across.  The hair is bright orange and the doll comes with a row of 10 different barrettes to put in her hair and a brush that goes along with it.The doll has big, bright blue button eyes, and sweet high-top plastic tennis shoes on.  Her dress is a plaid number made from real clothe and her legs are pink polka-dot plastic.What really surprised me about this doll was the packaging.  She comes in a large, clear plastic carrying case with a bright orange handle shaped like a rope with hearts on it.  Tied to the package is a paper award badge that tells you the doll's name(Bea Spells-a-lot), her birthday(October 16) and her personality(a smarty-pants).There's even pictures of hairstyles you can give your doll on a long, heavy, paper strip that should stand up to a lot of handling.  This is a sweet, colorful doll that gives kids something to do(create hairstyles).  I imagine that my niece will be loving Bea for a long time.  She's very appealing(niece and doll)."
Perfect choice for my 11 yr old grand daughter.  She'll love this funny red-head & all the accessories.  Lalaloopsy was on her wish list.
Bought this for my 4 year old (along with Pix E Flutters doll) and she LOVES these :) She takes these with her EVERYWHERE. Definitely a hit :) (And they're really cute!)
My granddaughter is going to just love this!!! She really wanted one of these dolls for Christmas. I am very pleased with it.
"My granddaughter's favourite dolls are the Lalaloopsy, she brings them with her whenever she comes for visits and plays with them all the time."
"This is a high quality Cartoon Doll that finally a toy company created correctly and is a great doll series to collect. Here's why:1. Look at the doll in its box and each one in the series is perfectly designed from head to toe including the packaging. The colors, clothing, hair, accessories are all detailed and matched to create a lovely theme for each doll.2. When you hold the doll it feels sort of like a rag doll in your hands but is a very unique cartoonish feel because it is not a normal balanced doll and you would not want a cartoon doll to feel balanced in your hands. It has a heavy head that wobbles like the rest of the arms and legs which is a lot of fun because it is so different.3. The smooth plastic of the doll feels wonderful and appears flawless like a cartoon. The features on the face are child safe but makes the cartoon come to life.4. The silly hair is a blast to bend to style and special needs kids of all ages love it too.5. The birthdate and serial number of the doll is on the back of the doll too for collecting.This is the first cartoon doll that actually got it right because of all of the above and the Silly Hair feature is what makes this doll absolutely perfect for kids and adults collecting or just playing!"
"I have to admit that Bea looks better in the Silly Hair version. The school girl uniform on the original Bea is not as cute as the outfit worn by Bea Silly Hair. This one was a gift for a 5 year old girl, which she really enjoyed playing with. I have noticed that Bea has same hair style as Jewel in both the original and silly hair versions. The silly hairs on the pet owl are odd and supposed to be ""wings"" lol. I plan on getting another Lalaloopsy Silly Hair of Bea Spells a Lot just to collect myself."
I bought this for my niece for her birthday. She loves it! Fits her lalaloopsy dolls perfectly. Great birthday gift.
"My daughters really love this little outfit for their Lalaloopsy dolls. And it was a good deal, too.  You can't beat it!"
"Super boring. I though it would have more adult material in it, seeing as how this is the ""adult"" version. However, most/ all of the cards we played so far are things like, ""bowling alley"" ""toothpick"" ""cotton ball"", and are just boring."
This game is a lot of fun...our whole family enjoyed it!!
"Frustrating, holy cow!The concept is really cool: Put a card on your forehead, ask yes/no/could be questions, and figure out what's on your forehead.Yeah, no.The words/phrases/people you're trying to guess are just too vague - we put in a ""house rule"" that you could ask for a category.It's a short timer. By the time I made any headway (pun intended), the timer ran out. Then, I had to answer other peoples' questions about their cards, before we got back to my forehead card - and by then I had forgotten what I had found out. I'd say to take notes while asking, but there's no time. Jeez. I'm not THAT old ..."
Gift
fun game...kind of hard though
"The game is great. But when I received the package, half of the game box was destroyed."
"Fun game, but be leary it does say for adults. My daughter has especially enjoyed it over the holidays."
This is a blast!
Awesome game
"Played  this game with another couple, found it to be very frustrating.  I wouldn't buy it again"
"We love all the new mini lalaloopsy dolls, the paint detail seems to be a lot better than the older ones."
Muchas gracias!!!
Excellent product and service.
Very cute!
Great item
Great game. Played with ages 22 to 84 and everyone loved it.  Lots of laughs.
fun game
So much fun
My and my friends LOVE this game!! Comes with 6 heads bands it's a MUST for any game night
"Very fun game, but we made up our own simplified rules.  Everyone loves it!"
fun game
Fun
"You would think because it's ""Adult"" this game would have ""Adult"" kind of stuff in it.  But it's really 20 questions...BORING!  If I wanted to play 20 questions, I would just play 20 questions.  The other HedBanz game, Act Up is way more fun because it's a charades game."
Perfect for adults and kids to spend time laughing together! Definitely recommend both product and seller!
A great game for young people and adults.  Lots of laughs with the antics of trying toget you to say what is on the card....Good party game.
Fun game but difficult! We ended up making up some of our own rules.
I purchased this game as a Christmas present for a friends son.  Though he is only 9 years old he really likes the game.  It is almost worn out it has been played so much!  Need I say more?
"We started out with the young people's version of this game, and it's awesome! We had to try this adult version. It is a lot more difficult which only adds to the fun! This game is great to play with old friends or family at gatherings, and it is also super to play with new friends as an ice breaker. Hedbanz is a game you want to have in your home to pull out and use whenever you can. It really is a game you can play with a wide variety of ages. There are even easy ways to modify the game if this one is too hard for the younger people in your life. You can always limit the choices to only people or only places etc. to narrow the playing field for less seasoned players. Also, I found it to be a great review/learning tool. You can make your own cards using regular index cards and then use it as a game to go over topics such as: presidents, states, vocabulary and so on. It requires some thinking which is always a good thing. We look forward to hours and hours of fun with this!"
"So glad that I purchased this for Christmas.  Opened, brought it to the family gathering and had lots and lots of laughs with it.  Loads of fun!"
Great game to play with the family from ages 14 to 85.  Had a great time Christmas day with it.
"Even though the ""review this product"" questions asked are somewhat inappropriate for this adult game (educational???), I must let people know that this is a simple yet hilarious game for grown-ups.  Only recently available in the U.S. in the adult version, I had played this game in Canada and have been looking for it in the U.S. for over a year.  Great fun - especially if you're having a drink or two while playing.  Highly recommend."
"this is a great party or group game, and can be funny what people guess. if nobody is good at guessing then the game might continue for a while, it might be a good traditionaly game, but isnt very good to play over, and over again."
"This game is the most fun I ever had playing any game...Sometimes it gets pretty hard, but that is the funniest part...I absolutely love it!"
"This is a super fun game that we play with our neighbors when we have a game night.  I got it at Toys R Us for $10, so don't pay $20!"
"This game is so much fun!!  It is not as easy as you may think, but great fun with a group of family and/or friends.  And...it looks pretty ridiculous too :)"
Cute rainbow great
I knew what I ordered and it was as expected.
great puzzles
My girls and nieces loved this!!
Daughter loves them! They are very colorful and glittery!
Gave these as a gift and they were a hit. Lalaloopsy is great for those individuals who can no longer handle the small pieces. Perfect size for them too.
My 3 year old daughter loves Lalaloopsy stuff and loves these puzzles.  They are bit challenging for her since the backgrounds are so colorful and busy and she loves the glitter on them.  They definitely keep her occupied!
"I got this set for my six year old and four year old daughters. They both love puzzles, this was a little difficult because they are so colorful it was harder for them to figure out by color where pieces should go. This maybe easier for them in a year or two. The quality is good, but the boxes are the open the way cereal boxes open so using a Ziploc bag to keep the pieces together is what we are doing."
"I got these puzzles as a birthday gift for my five-year-old niece, and she LOVES them!  They're perfect for her skill level, and very cute."
"My four year old just recently got into Lalaloopsy, so these puzzles were perfect.  She has one other 60 piece puzzle, so I knew she could do it, we just needed some more.  :)  It's a little challenging for her, but the more she does it, the better she gets.  Cute pictures, cam undamaged."
"Daughter is obsessed with shopkins, she loves these.  They are pretty cute ;)"
"These ridiculous little things are pretty cute and really make my nieces happy so I'll get them to feel like the greatest aunt in the world, but there's really not much to them. I think the big idea is they try to collect them all so finding the ones they don't have, I imagine, can be quite difficult once the collection grows. But for starter's, sets like this one offer a few different Shopkins and one surprise! And the cost is a little more efficient than buying the single ones. Overall, my niece was very happy with her new ""babies"" and she got ones she didn't already have. Arrived on time and well packaged, also."
Perfect!
Everyone at school liked them.
"The description says that styles will vary, and the Q and A says that if you buy two or more, you will receive different styles, but my daughter got duplicates (we ordered two packages) and is really disappointed."
My granddaughter just loved them.
I was not pleased with this item.  I found it much cheaper at Target.  I would not buy these again.
"This is the Shopkins Season 2 five-pack.  You know 4 of the Shopkins that you will be getting shown on the bubble pack plus a hidden ultra-rare surprise Shopkin.  This one will be sealed in yellow bag on the bottom of the pack.  Every pack comes with a shopping list of every Shopkins available for the season.  Also included are 5 silicone purple (as opposed to blue for Season 1) shopping bags to house each of the figure.  They are supercute and kids love to collect them.I don't know what is behind the craze but my daughter is currently among those who are going crazy with these teeny little toys.  They are sold out in every Tar-J stores we go.  In the last two birthday parties that she went, Shopkins are on the top of the list.Toy is rated for ages five and up because they are literally bite size.  Younger kids who want to put things in their mouth should not play with them.Sample item was provided for review."
As I expected
Delivered as expected very popular with these kids now days
Got some double packs
Perfect!!!! and so cute.
My kids (2 and 3 years old) love these Shopkins! They are crazy for them. This package also comes with one blind bag which was an ultra rare! The little Shopkins hold up to bath time and hours of play. Keep in mind the age recommendation. My kids never had a problem with putting little toys in their mouths.
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old daughter and she loves this new season, which is very hard to find in stores. Looking forward to buying more!"
As ordered. Cute little collectible toys.
Grandchild loved these. Plays with them all day and it keeps her quiet for awhile while grandmom does other things in house. Thanks.
"Excellent gift, arrived on time!"
i love it omg lol im about ht bass
My grand daughter loved them!
Amazing!  My daughter was more than happy with these.  No duplicates either :)
loved them!!!!! So cute and fun. The only reason for 3 stars is the PRICING!!! Too much !
Couldn't go wrong with Shopkins this year.
Good product
Bought as a gift to my niece for her Loopsy doll.  It was a great addition to her Christmas gift (a new LaLaLoopsy doll).  She loved the outfit and it was a great price!
my little girl loved these clothes for her doll.  Excellent quality at great prices. Definitely worth purchasing and will be back again for more. Thanks!
Wanted to get a supplemental set of outfits for the Lalaloopsy doll and this fit the bill just as planned.
Our nearly 5 year old granddaughter loves the Lalaloopsy dolls.  She has a bunch of the minis and one of the larger dolls (which is the one that this dress fits).  I love the fact that they're easier for little hands to dress and undress.  Plus this party dress and the matching shoes are so colorful and particularly cute.  What fashion-minded doll wouldn't want to wear it?
It's a Christmas gift for my five year old granddaughter.  Really hope she likes it.  I think it's absolutely adorable.
The Lalaloopsy doll is simply a great doll with a wonderful story line. A rag doll that has come to life is genius. The dresses are beautiful and durable. All of the kids I know are in love with this doll and all of the great clothes. I highly recommend this product to add to your Lalaloopsy collection. MGA has a winner!
Nice product.
Bought it and didn't realize that it is tiny!Daughter liked it for a day and now it is just sitting around and we have already lost the spoon 5 times!!
"Love it ! It was Great Purchase and Great Quality, Good Deal Overall. Definitely happy with this Purchase. Met My Expectations"
"I didnt understand how small the minis were they are super tiny like little figures tiny, but my kiddos love them so good to go!"
"So cute! I accidentally ordered the wrong doll, but my daughter loves it anyway!! Arrived quickly in perfect condition! Very happy with this purchase!"
It was the perfect gift!  My granddaughter collects the Lalaloopsy Mini Dolls and she absolutely was thrilled to get Mittens!
"My four year old Grand-Daughter Loves these dolls, she play's with them for hours, making them priceless, Thank you so much :)"
I searched online with my 6 year old granddaughter for the Lalaloopsy items she wanted for her birthday.  She was very excited when she got them and takes them everywhere.
I expected to receive this product in the same condition you would buy it in a store and was not disappointed.  It was perfect.
"Mittens Fluff'n'Stuff is a cute little figure skater wearing pink ice skates.  She comes with a snow globe, a bowl of cereal with a spoon, and her pet is some kind of mouse bear (I think).  Mittens has blue hair and is wearing a white hoodie and blue leggings.  According to her bio Mittens loves hot cocoa, snow fights and snuggling by the fire.Like the other Mini Lalaloopsies, Mittens is tiny and has somewhat fragile legs.  She will not stand on her own.  This cute little doll is sure to be loved by any Lalaloopsy collector."
"very disappointed at the size of the doll! I know it said mini but being a grandma not familiar with toys I compared price to size ,bought another lalaloopsy doll for 16.97 that was full size"
"Good product but when they say ""Mini"" they mean it, it's small!"
Perfect!
The puppy has heart shaped ears which is so cute.  The dolls are so detailed and sweet.  A big hit.
The details don't really tell you what size this is and I couldn't tell by the pictures.  I'm not that familiar with the Lalaloopsy doll so I had no idea that the 'mini' doll was so small.  I was purchasing it for my granddaughter. I had to go to the store to find one that was right for her.
"I wanted something my retarded family could play all together without being grossed out or uncomfortable. This game is easy to follow and pretty fun! Although my sister got really mad after we all had gotten about 8 cards and she was STILL on her first one. She couldn't get ""Milan""...a city in Italy. That's probably because she's stupid. I didn't like that they had cards that were SO obvious that after 3 hints you could guess the noun. My mom had ""superwoman"". She got it in 3 guesses. I think she cheated. She probably could see the reflection in my idiot uncle's glasses. I don't know why he was playing because he's partially deaf and was asking us to repeat our answers to his guesses so often I wanted to throw the vase sitting next to me at his face. All in all this game was fun and can be used to make money. We all put in five bucks and the winner won thirty dollars. Yippie! It wasn't me. So I was pissed."
Really fun game even for adults. Allot of people haven't played it so its a different spin. Also once you have the head band you can make your own cards and get endless replay ability.
Lots and lots of fun.
Hard!
Very fun game!
Great game!  Fast shipment.  Everything was brand new.  I always bring this game out when company is over and it is a big hit!
Fun party game for all ages!!!! Enjoy it
good game although my niece and nephew played and got most right and they're only 6 and 8. fun fun fun
Pretty funny game.  Best if played with four or more -- and a couple of glasses of wine each.
NOT VERY FUN AND A WASTE OF MONEY
"Not my kind of game, but the fam likes it."
This was a gift and the recipients really enjoyed playing game.
love the game. Happy to purchase it online at a cheaper price than whats in the stores.
OMG my family had the biggest laugh playing this. Great family game and I would highly recommend it to anyone. Fast delivery too!
Fun game!
Harder than it looks!!!
FUN GAME
Great for all ages...and makes all players think.
Was a gift. Friends happy.
Amazing fun with family and friends.
"Hedbanz is an all-inclusive game that requires you to be a detective...of sorts. You have no idea who or what you are & you need to ask the animal, vegetable or mineral/male? female? kinds of questions that can be answered in a yes or no by the other players. Only you're timed. It can be quite funny & the innuendo can be very broad. It can also be frustrating when you are having difficulty guessing your who or what. You have as many rounds as necessary to guess. If you guess quickly you get another card & resume guessing till your time has run out. It really is a great game for as many as 6 people; more if you don't mind not having a plastic adjustable headband. It makes a fab addition to your game library."
So fun . . . and challenging
You can buy on your app store for $1.99 It is better to go that route than buy the game. It wasn't even fun.
Have friends over for game night. Make Margaritas or cosmos and play Head Banz.  You will laugh till you cry.
"My daughter is really enjoying puzzles right now, she is four. We surprised her with this set for a recent trip and she really liked them. Needed just a bit of assistance, but that is typical for her with all puzzles right now."
"My 7 year old loved these puzzles.  She put them all together in a couple hours, wouldn't stop until she had completed them all."
"We bought these puzzles for our 4 year old Lalaloopsy fan for Christmas. She was very excited about them and immediately wanted to put them together. They were more challenging for her, but it was a good activity for us to do together. The pictures are bright and vibrant and of course sparkly (which makes everything more fun). The pieces were a bit dusty coming out of the bag, but not a huge deal. Definitely worth the price for 3 puzzles!"
"I ordered these puzzles as a reward for my daughter as she learns her flashcard words. She is 3 and does a lot of 100 piece puzzles, but these are difficult.  The image is very detailed and the pieces are a unique shape. I love that it is a challenging puzzle, but also has bigger pieces that are harder to get lost!  The best is that they are MADE IN THE USA!My only complaint is that the puzzles listed are not what we received.  We received Tippy Tumbelina, Sahara Mirage, Berry Jars and Jam.  I am just warning you in case you already bought any of these individually at TRU.  If not they are great puzzles and worth the extra money to be MADE IN THE USA!"
I needed some new puzzles for my 5-year-old that were more challenging for her.  She loves Lalaloopsy and these are super cute and affordable.
"My 3 year old and I really enjoy these Lalaloopsy puzzles. Since receiving them, we put them together just about every day. The pictures on the puzzles are very cute and the puzzles are just challenging enough for us both to enjoy."
"Gave this to my 6-year old granddaughter.  She loved it.  Money came is $1, $2, $3, $4, $5 denominations so it was very easy to handle the money.  (also great to make change)  It was educational while having fun.  Hotels are ""castles"", die is pink; perfect for any female that adores princesses.  Directions and rules age appropriate so your child will not be discouraged playing this version of Monopoly."
Great game to teach little ones about counting money
"My 6 year old daughter, in love with all things Disney Princess, loved this game. This variation on Monopoly has Disney Princesses for pawns (the pieces you move around the board). The princess buys a house (a castle) for the different Disney characters on each space she lands on around the board. No hotels or houses keeps things simple. Also, instead of the $1-$500 denominations in the original Monopoly; Monopoly Junior Princess has $1, $2, $3, $4, and $5 bills only. So it is a good reinforcement of basic addition and subtraction.There is very little to no strategy in the game, pretty much pure luck. Which makes it sorta tough for adults to play more than a couple times, but it is perfect for kids. My daughter could legitimately beat me about half the time.I do wish that there were non-princess game pieces so that male siblings, cousins, and friends could play without ""being girls,"" but they get over it quickly or you can cut out pictures of boy characters from the internet and make your own.I was pleasantly surprised with this game. It's a good, fun introduction to monopoly."
"The game was in good condition, all pieces were there. It was definitely worth the price. We are very satisfied."
"The game was exactly what they were looking for.  For a used game, it was in excellent shape with all of the pieces, and a bonus game even arrived with it.  Very happy!!  Thank you so much.  It's making a special family very happy."
Teaches playing with others and reading (chance cards) along with counting money. Worked for a 5 year old granddaughter. Awesome!
My daughter loves this game and it gives her a fun way to practice addition and subtraction and such.  For the grown-ups it's nice that a typical game lasts only about 20 minutes or so.
A great game with great shipping that keeps little (or big) princesses active in the game. all in all it is a very good game
"They are cute and easy to lose. Didn't know they were pencil erasers until I red up on them. Season 1 & 2, again, didn't know it was a cartoon somewhere but all the kids live then in my daughter's kiddy class. 3 stars because they are waaaay over-priced"
Great! My niece was very happy..
This also was priced outrageous! Over $17.00 for this! I was taken again!!!!
Love them
Hard to find these new guys but the Grand loved it.....
"Awesome, affordable toy! My daughter is obsessed!"
Extremely over priced for what they are but I bought them anyway. Bought this as a gift and the little girl loved them. They were shipped on time and the packaging was nice.
I know nothing about Shopkins but my 8 year old loves them and she was very happy with these.
Very overpriced for just 5 figurines not 5 packs. Will return for 15 for the same price season 1!
Way over priced. Toys R Us has these in stock for 5.99.
This is awesome!:)I finally get to see S2 AWSOME IM GONNA TRY ORDER
Cute
"My son loves this shopkins. He kept hoping to get it as a surprise in the packages, but it broke my heart each time he did not, so I had to order it online. It was worth to see a smile on his face."
Awesome
Happy
Too small for the price.
"Very happy with the Shopkin, this one is adorable also and a great price on Amazon."
"adorable, my 5 year old granddaughter loved it."
Cute pretzel
A gift for a child who loved this!
"I did not like that the product had been removed from it's original packaging. It looks cheap and not able to give as a gift as it looks used. No fun for my kids to open, as it has no packaging. There was no mention of this when making the purchase."
Loved it!
Super fast shipping! Very satisfied. Thanks!
My daughter took 5 seconds to fall in love with this doll. Perfect size for my 8 year old and 2 year old.
"My daughter (4) and I both love the look of this Lalaloopsy, her theme and outfit are both fun and cute, but her accessory wand is a bit disappointing.  I feel like it could very easily have been made with a loop of sorts on the backside so that the doll could actually hold the wand.  As it stands, it's just another small piece that is oft lost in her other toys and not really utilized in play as she has to hold it in the doll's hand, which isn't uber fun for me as an adult with big hands trying to keep this tiny wand ""near"" the doll's hand, or my daughter with her tiny less dexterous hands.  This isn't unusual for Lalaloopsy to make relatively unpractical accessories, but especially dissapointing with this doll as we liked the magician theme so much."
"Bought this for the kids for Christmas, they have played with the game almost daily.  Its fun for all age groups, even Dad gets involved in this one.  You might look goofy wearing the hedbanz, but its a great laugh and fun for all."
This game is a lot of fun for even just two people or more.  Good for grown up game night.
"I purchased this for my boys, ages 11 & 13 as the children's version was too simplistic.  The premise of this game is that you must ask a series of questions to determine that you are....Arnold Schwarzeneggar.  It's random, difficult and tedious.  Especially for the price."
I bought this game for my 13 year old daughter. The whole family played the game and it is great for all ages.  She loves it!!
"Got Hedbanz for my yearly christmas party with friends.  We usually got with trivia games, but I wanted to change it up this year.I figured Hedbanz would be a non-thinking game and would be pretty easy for everybody.  Unfortunately, the game as it is suggested, is much harder than it seems.  After a trial run with 8 people trying twice, only two of us were able to get the guess correct in the time the timer allows.We actually ended up having more fun slightly altering the rules and getting rid of the question round and going into the one-word clue round.  We got into teams so everybody had a reason to give good clues and went around giving our teammates clues.  For each clue it took, your team got one point.  At the end, the team with the least points (and least guesses) won.  It went much quicker (almost too quick, though) and was easier for everybody who struggled the ""real"" way.Anyway, I would suggest changing the rules as your team needs.  Don't be afraid to customize the game.There seems to be enough cards for five or six playthroughs even with the same group.  Even after you have to repeat cards, they are general enough that the clues/questions will continue to be different.The head bands themselves were bigger than I expected, and fit me well.  They have a few different size notches, so just about everybody should be fine.  I didn't notice anything that warrants the ""adults"" tag, except that maybe the bands wouldn't fit somebody smaller and that the original game play was a bit hard for our group of ~25 year olds.With some rules tweaking, this game could be a winner. Also, keep in mind you're gonna need a good group to play with.  We had a few duds in ours!"
good quality and so cute.
"Cute, but they're Polly Pocket-sized.  I was expecting larger. My fault for not reading more carefully."
My daughter is a huge Lalaloopsy fan and has played with these miniatures almost every day since she got them. They are adorable!
Great product.
Granddaughter seems to like her gift.
As described.
daughter luved it!!!!
"Very small pieces, used them as a cake topper for my 3 year old. She loved them, but I have to watch her very close when she has them."
excelente
My  daughter loves these dolls. I think they are a little odd. But it is not what I think it is what she likes.
I am more and more disappointed in the production of toys available to our children today. They are of poor quality and too costly for the material and workmanship used.
"I purchased these as a gift for my eight year old grand daughter and she just loves playing with them.These are mini size dolls,which are perfect for small hands.They are really cute and made well. I would recommend this product."
"The little girl that received this as a gift was totally happy with each item in the package, fits in well with all her other figures."
My two granddaughters were very happy to see this toy on Christmas. The love the characters and played with the dolls all day. The little dog and elephant were not played with but the lalaloopsy characters were a great fun toy!
We played this as an ice breaker for a work function and people liked it so much that we had to bring it back for day two of the conference!
Have a family of 8 with ages 5-69 and did couples with Grama and Grampa as a team and made up rules for the younger kids to get involved very fun and lots of laughter
This game can be fun when everyone is on board. It's fun watching adults sitting around w/headbands on their heads. More fun when you've had a few beforehand.
This is such a fun game! I have played the kid version but this version is way more difficult and fun for adults!
I purchased this for a gift for my husband.  we had a blast playing this with some of our friends.
"This game is a blast, but in my opinion a little too hard, especially for teenagers.  I realize it's called Adult HedBanz, but it can be pretty difficult. I don't know that I would play this as a family,  even with older kids. Still, for adults it's a lot of fun."
"I used this game for international students in college as an activities to practice speaking skills in English, all loved it."
"I feel a little silly for buying this one...my daughter in law reminded me that it is basically the $20, closet-space-requiring version of the ice-breaker came where you put post-it notes on each other's foreheads and then try to guess what the post-it note says.Plus it's not really that much fun.  Too hard/frustrating, and it's not that we're stupid - our family consists of MD, BSEE, and even the two kids with BS and MA.Will probably take it to the Goodwill.  It had really great ratings, so maybe some other family will enjoy it more.  We have tried a couple times but keep giving up in favor of something more fun like Apples to Apples or Taboo."
This game is really good clean fun!  It's a big hit with family and friends!  Thanks for the timely shipment.
I bought this game for my inlays as a Christmas present. It was a blast. They play it all the time with their friends now too. Would definitely recommend. Looking forward to buying the children's version when my son is older...
"This is a very fun family oriented game, lots of laughs, it defiinitely makes it to the top 5 in our closet."
We played this game at a friend's home over Christmas - what a tremendous hoooooot! Loved it. Just get a small gang together and prepare to laugh.
"This is a fun game that a lot of people can play in a relaxed setting.  It doesn't require a board or pieces, so even non-board game adults can enjoy it.  It can be frustrating, but also create a lot of laughs."
"I love all kinds of party games and hadn't tried this one when I bought it as a Christmas gift. We played it with my family (ages 22-55) and everyone seemed to have a pretty good time. It was fairly difficult to figure out your answer, especially if you have a lot of players. Some friends changed the rules to have everyone act out the headband answer, and they seemed to enjoy that more (it's easier... and you can more easily guess if you've been drinking...). So if you're up for a challenge, this is a good game. If you want something a little more crazy and easy, you might go with Ellen's game--Heads Up."
"Yep! Wearing the headbands may be a little silly, but my family has a great time playing it and it's not too difficult but it can fill an hour easily."
Great game. We all (six 30 somethings) sat around playing this on a Saturday night. We had a blast!!! We laughed so much and we are still talking about it!
"Santa left this under the tree for my family.  My teenage daughter, husband and I have been enjoying this game.  Lots of fun, laughter, and at times frustration when we can't guess the answer.  Good family game for older kids."
"I'm a college student and I bought this to enjoy with my family over winter break. Needless to say, we all laughed until we cried trying to determine what the word was.We skip over the ones no one could possibly guess and still have a great time. The people playing were all between the ages of 10 to 48 so definitely a good game for everyone."
"My 4 going on 5 yr old nephew loves playing board games with us, and I knew games like Life and Monopoly would take way too long for him to stand. We played this and it was still on the outer edges of his attention span, but he made it. The way the chance card system is set up encourages monopolies (all consist of only 2 properties) which leads to the end of the game (when one player goes broke) more quickly. Took about a half an hour.  Counting out the money and figuring out who owes whom how much are great introductions to adding and subtracting. The base fell off one of the princess player pieces one time. Go to Lunch instead of Go to Jail is a fun change, and landing on the piles of cash on the ""loose change"" (Free Parking in Monopoly Sr.) is fun especially for the kids as well. It is a faithful miniturization of the Monopoly game we all know and is a great introduction to it."
"The board is too small, the game pieces are terrible, too flimsy, the printing on the board is too small. The princesses are made of paper punchouts inserted into a paper base. The game board should have been larger and the game pieces should have been made from cardboard, to insert into a plastic base or made of all plastic. As it is the game pieces have difficulty in standing and the slightest breath or movement on the board makes them fall down. Also the castle markers are made of paper and move around on their own while moving the pieces around the board. The only well constructed part of this game is the box. Don't buy this game, it is a rip off."
"When I first bought this game for my daughter and took it out of the box I was surprised by the inferior quality. For a split second I thought this must be some kind of prototype version, but then I came to my senses and acknowledged the fact that I was completely ripped off. I expected better of the Monopoly and Disney brands than to pass off small paper boards and tokens as anything resembling marketable; in fact, the whole game reminds me of a cheap knock-off you might find at a flea market.The sad thing is that the concept is a good one. The property names and character pawns get you into the Disney spirit and the denominations are small enough that younger kids can easily keep up. Play time is short enough for young attention spans. But all this is forgotten the first time an enthusiastic child rolls the dice too hard over the board and you lose all the tokens and pawns, forcing you to scramble to put everything back in place. Our board doesn't sit flat, which makes things slide and barely stand, and the flimsy pawn stands are already worn enough that they don't stand well anyway. Also the properties are so small you have to move the castle tokens to read where you landed.It's a shame they were so incredibly cheap about this game. The simple things about any board game that you may take for granted, like stability and at least SOME quality, are missing, which makes it such a hassle to play that we don't have much fun with it. And isn't fun the point of a game?"
"I bought this game at a Thrift Store for one dollar.  It looked brand new making me think it might not be so fun.  But, my husband and I play it and think it's okay.  No thinking involved and no property cards to keep track of! The board is WAY to small, though.  I think with small hands not being so careful it could be a big problem.  Everything is crowded together.  The Chance cards are very small and thin making it very hard to pick them up.  The movable princesses are just printed on cardboard that don't stay in their plastic stands.  Those are way too big, also. A slimmer plastic version of the princesses, even if not painted, would have been a big improvement.  Overall this is a fun game to play and not too complicated."
"We bought this game for our 5 year old daughter since she loves Disney Princess so much, its lots of fun and very easy to play, the instructions are simple and easy to remember. We love it, worth the money."
"We bought this for my daughter thinking it was the Monopoly style, just using princesses.  We were very wrong.  The pawns are actually paper (you punch them out of a card) and stuck into little plastic stands.  The game board is even cheap paper...and bends very easily, and sometimes even lays flat enough to allow the pawns to stay upright and in the right spaces.  This game was destroyed in only a few playings.  Don't waste your money on this garbage.  Buy a better game that will last for a while."
"First let me say the pricing here must me a typo. I bought this game at Target for less than $[...]. I would never pay $46 as it has cheaply made game pieces and will not last for years but serves its purpose. My 5 yr old daughter loves the Disney princesses and wants to play this game literally everyday. She has learned so much, counting, taking turns, following rules, being a good looser ect...We have had it a year now and we still play but not as often. This was a great game for us. We love this game."
"Would it break the Disney bank to provide a CARDBOARD gameboard and some PLASTIC game pieces?  ALL the pieces in this otherwise delightful game are made of PAPER, making them too flimsy to stay in place during play."
Great toy for kids over 3. The shoes come off so you don't want a kid playing with it that still puts stuff in their mouth.My girls love this and I got one for my wife's desk at work!
Cute doll...great price...shipped within a decent amount of time. No complaints.
This is my niece's favorite doll.  Adorable!
very cute
This was the perfect Easter present. # lalaloopsy insiders
"Couldn't find this one locally, so we were happy to find her at Amazon. She's one of the cutest Littles! Love her outfit, hairdo, and pet carrot! Wish she had bows on her little ponytails!"
Delivered in great condition and such a cute durable doll my 3yr old loved it
"Just love her, this is for my granddaughters Christmas."
my daughter love it
As described good product
My daughter loved it!
Excelent every thing arrived at time
Oh my daughter loves little Tricky Mysterious! She is the most adorable little thing. My toddler boy is always snatching her up. She is his favorite doll.
"The doll is adorable, but its quality is rather poor. I ordered two different Lalaloopsy LIttles (Tricky Mysterious and Kiwi Tiki Wiki) and both dolls had dark spots and shiny marks on the vinyl, and also uneven paint and smudges on their hair and/or shoes. The dolls I ordered were supposed to be a gift and I felt uncomfortable giving a gift in this condition. Returning for a refund."
I purchased this doll for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  it is just super cute and was a bargain.
"This was a birthday gift for my three-year-old daughter, and she loves it. I don't love that there are so many little pieces to it (2 gloves, 2 shoes, wand, and pet) because I know they'll get lost, but oh well."
Lalaloopsy Littles are oh so cute and have the high quality of the original Lala dolls. These are a favorite gift in my home!
"I love the loopy hair dolls because the hair doesn't get all ratty like Barbies, Monster High, and Equestria Girls.  It's easy to comb out over a year later!"
awesome thanks came next day wow!
I am very Happy with my purchase. An delivery.
Wonderful quick delivery. My daughter loves the doll.
Granddaughters did not really play with this
Granddaughter likes her! Especially her pink color.
Such a cute doll. Being able to comb the hair is a plus.
Daughter loves the doll. Was a little sad she didn't come with her pet like the other dolls do. She still loves it though.
Very cute excellent
nice
"These are the mini-sized dolls.  The girls (9 years) loved them!  They like the small accessories as well, and the little house that is also the box."
"they are very cute my daughter loves them! Perfect for little girls (although not so little, my daughter has 8 years old). I would recommend this product."
I found that these are adorable figures with accessories.  My grand daughter loved them and plays with them daily. recommend!
Great purchase at the price you paid for it.Is a nice product and if building with a great qualityVery cool
These are cute and well-made.  My granddaughter loves them.  You will not be disappointed in the quality or the value.
Exactly as described.  Thankyou
Great gift
"My toddler loves her big Jewel Sparkles, just wish there was a way she could sit up! Don't mind the big head or rag doll quality (in that she falls over) just maybe we'd have more luck propping her up if her head wasn't so heavy. Besides that we love playing with her!"
Nice
Niece was so excited about it
EXCELLENT ARTICLE. EXPECTATIONS FULFILLED THAT DESCRIBED IN THE SITE. VERY GOOD SUPPLIER. I RECOMMEND IT. VERY GOOD CARE.
i have her little sister Trinket
Like it
"Jewel is sometimes hard to find at a good price, since she's a main character of 'Lalaloopsy' so when I found her for $20 on Amazon, I had to buy. As always, the lalaloopsy dolls are cute and good quality. My daughter loves her!"
"My niece received a number of Lalaloopsy dolls for her birthday. Although she loved each and every one, this particular doll was a hit with my 4 yr. niece!"
I bought this set of lalaloopsy dolls for my niece for Christmas.  She loves all of the lalaloopsy products.  I love the little elephant named peanut.  It's so cute.  These are great for little girls with big imaginations.  I like that the box can be reused to store the dolls and their accessories.
As I am doing my reviews it seems like I bought my niece a ton of these these for her birthday. She loves them.
"Love these mini dolls. Cute little collection of mini dolls with companion animals. Well made and cute distinct features. Great for traveling, long car rides and taking to grandma's. Would love to have a small storage case for these."
MY SON LOVES THESE LOLI'S. ONE DAY HE WILL GUI=VE TO SISTER OR THEY WILL GO ON EBAY BECAUSE THEY ARE PERFECT AND EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED.
"I bought these along with Mini Lalaloopsy Carry Along Playhouse with Exclusive Doll and Mini Lalaloopsy Fun House Charlotte and Blossom, Pack of 2.  She still plays with it very frequently."
Once again my daughter loves lalaloopsy she has been playing with them since they came out what more can I say
I bought this toy for my daughter who loves Lalaloopsy toys. They have lots of fun using their imaginations with these toys.
My little girl was thrilled with this item and absolutely loves it.  Completely satisfied.  I would buy this item again.
"these mini lalaloopsy fun house peanut and Ember pack is a great gift.  I will give them to my granddaughter on her birthday, along with the fun house."
both purchases were splended...the necklace made a big hit with grand-son and the HedBanz game a big hit with adults.thanks very much.7757patricia
"We played over and over. Amazing how hard it can be, but if you ask all the questions on the discussion board helps lot."
"It's really a nice funny group game, I had some new friends coming over and this game was an icebreaker, we had lots of fun."
Fun simple game for adults.  I ordered. Couple for young adult gifts and they were popular. I would recommend this to friends and for gifts.
"After many years of having 15 people at my house Christmas Eve, this year was going to be quite different.  It was only going to be my family (5 of us) and my daughter's boyfriend (in their 20's) whom I had met only a few times.  How were we going to pass the time??  I decided to buy HedBanz.  It was so much fun!!! We probably spent 2 hours playing and we never laughed so hard.  It was so much fun that my daughter took it to her boyfriend's house for New Years."
game was in perfect condition and it was a lot of fun i would absolutely recommend this game to my friends
"OK, we had such a laugh after Thanksgiving dinner with this game. My friends, family and even some of the teens after dinner enjoyed and laughed so hard.  It's a very easy game to play with no fuss nor complicated rules. Just place the card on your head, turn over the timer, ask the questions and guess. Easy peasy & fun.  I enjoyed it so much that I bought more and gave them as Christmas Gifts.  Next time we may make up our own guess cards to mix in even more fun."
We love this game fun for friends and family great fun for 2 or more payers. Gets you thinking. Highly recommend.
"We are a game family and we're always on the lookout for a new one that we'll all enjoy. HedBanz for adults his all the marks for a good game - easy rules, a touch of silliness, and surprisingly challenging! It's basically like 20 questions where you have a word on your band that you can't see but the other players can. There is a one minute timer, and on your turn you ask yes and no questions until you are able to guess. Sometimes you get an idea in your head and it is so hard to figure out where you are going wrong. You start with three chips and get rid of one every time you get a correct guess and get one everything you give up lol. First one to get rid of their chips first wins. Some of the cards have been Bart Simpson, taco, and pajamas. Even tho it says adult, I think this is due to the difficulty of the cards, and not for any adult words, as far as I can tell after playing a few games."
"The kids version of this game is more fun and easier, this one is challenging and you end up giving hints to get them close to the correct answer. We also got CatchPhrase for the family and that game was a lot more fun to play"
This game is pretty fun. Not too hard after you learn the kind of questions you should be asking. Good buy!
Tons of fun for the family or groups of friends. Quick and simple to get started. Great game to take to a party.
"I bought the adult version for my family with two boys ages 16 and 13. We had words like Great Wall of China, Vet's Office, glasses. They were hard to figure out. Perhaps if we play more often everyone will organize their questions more effectively and efficiently. Otherwise, I should have purchased the kid version. Four stars just because I didn't know which version to purchase."
"Fun ! and good price, for a great game!  It was a gift for someone I am sure will enjoy it."
"I took HedBanz to a Christmas party and it was the highlight of the evening. Everyone there participated and had an awesomely, great time!  I recommend this game as an ice breaker at any party and you will surely bring out the party animal from within. Enjoy!"
"Played all day with family was great time, will be a hit at my house,thanks for recommending it,happy new year"
This is such a fun game for all ages!  The rules are cool but you can definitely alter them to add more of a challenge!  This is definitely a must have for all households that like to play games.  :)
It's a poor expansion of parlor game concept. Play the original without the headbands. Don't waste your money buying the box.
"My daughter recieved this for her fifth birthday.  At first I was unsure if we would be able to succesfully play the game.  But it was a blast.  I love that they did the money in 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 bills.  This is helping her so much in her number reconition.  The moving pieces is great for counting.  Paying people helps with basic addition since you have to figure out that 2 $2 bills is $4.  I never thought that there would be such an educational aspect to this game.  It was also a good bonding moment.  I am very happy with the concept behind the game (a bit different then regular monopoly).  Although the board is smaller I think it is the perfect size.  The only think I would change is the cardboard cut outs for pieces.  They are a little anoying keeping them in the stands but it makes perfect sence why they did it that way."
"My 4 year old received this as a Christmas present and though I was not initially thrilled with the Princess aspect, it really is working out quite well.  The game is a very simplified version of Monopoly with the money being kept in small denominations -- $1, $2, $3, $4 & $5 bills.  Since you have to pay rent, you have to be able to know how much to pay and how to give change.  For example if you land on a property where someone owns both of a color the rent is doubled so if you land on a $2 space you have to calculate how much is 2 + 2 and then how much change to give back if you are collecting the rent and how much to pay if you are paying the rent.  This becomes more complicated if you don't have $2 or $4 bills as kids need to know that 1 + 3 also equals $ and that 5 is bigger than 4 and you get change back.  While working on that concept has slowed the game down, I feel the benefit is huge and makes me more willing to tolerate the whole Princess thing!I would have given the game a much higher rating if the board had been bigger and the playing pieces hadn't been so cheap.  The board is about half the size of a regular Monopoly board even though it has almost the same number of properties.  The larger size of the playing pieces accomodate small hands, but the reduced size of the properties makes playing (particularly seeing where exactly your piece is) more difficult.  I also found it extremely annoying that you had to glue the numbers onto the single die.  What It would have cost to much to put in a real die????"
"My 5&1/2 year old daughter received this game for Christmas and it has been great!  It is nice to finally be able to play board games with her.  This game uses 1,2,3,4 and 5 ""dollar"" bills, so she is learning to add and make change as we play.  Great for number recognition as well.  Unlike traditional Monopoly, a game can be completed in under half an hour, so it holds her attention well without boring the adults.  We love this game!"
Every little girl should own this game.  It is played similar to the traditional Monopoly game but with all Princess themes. My daughter started to play this game successfully at age 4 and is still playing 2 years later!
"My daughters really loved the princess concept of the game.  The cards are easy to use and the castles are fun to own.  The down-side is that the actual game board is too small.  When 4 girls are trying to move their pieces around the board it becomes too crowded.  Just trying to keep the board steady is a job.  If two players land on the same space its hard to keep them both on that space until the next turn.  All in all, my daughters and niece ranging from ages 5-9 enjoyed the game.  As the game ""helper""  I wish the board were larger and heavier!"
"For some crazy reason, Amazon is currently mixing reviews for Disney Princess Monopoly Jr, Spinning Wishes, and Dress Up games.  All three games are listed as ""variations"" of the others, and the reviews for all 3 games are included under each game.  It is QUITE confusing.  So to be perfectly clear, this review is for the Disney Princess Monopoly Junior game ONLY!This is a very nice game, especially for the princess set.  We have had limited success in interesting our 5 year old daughter in board games, but the appeal of the Disney Princesses is working to create excitement for this game.The board is about half the size of a traditional Monopoly board, and the properties are all princess related, like Flounder & Eric versus Oriental & Connecticut.  A game of luck instead of skill, the players purchase any un-owned property they land on, and play until someone runs out of money.  You spend money when you buy property, pay rent to another property owner, or land on the dreaded Ursula or Maleficient!  Collect money by passing go or getting rent.  Playing pieces are cardboard cutouts of the princesses (Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Little Mermaid, Jasmine, Snow White, Belle, Mulan & Pocohantas) instead of hats, dogs or thimbles.  No houses or hotels here - just castles in pastel colors.  Land on the Magic Carpet or Cinderella's coach for an extra turn.  Who knows what will happen when you land on Chance - free properties, taxes, or trips to see Ursula or Maleficient.The main educational aspect is counting.  You count spaces as you  move around the board, and count money as you buy property, pay rent, or pay fines.  Reading is not really necessary.  Like the original Monopoly, there are a lot of pieces to this game - castles, playing pieces & stands, money and chance cards.  Pick up is an important part of the process.The only negatives are the playing pieces and the money.  The pieces don't stay in their stands very well, and can fall out when you're moving around the board.  Inconvenient, but livable.  The money is quite odd, because the demoninations are $1, $2, $3, $4, and $5. It's a little strange explaining to your child that there aren't any ""real"" $4 bills!  I assume the denominations are low to make the counting easier, but it is weird.Bottom line is that Monopoly Jr is a good game to start your younger kids on, and the princesses just add to the good time.  We're happy to have this game in our closet."
"We love this game.  Much more than I thought we would when we bought it.  I am a bit confused by some of the other reviewers comments.  Our game doesn't ""dress-up"".  We, like, the other positive reviewer have the cardboard cutouts of the princesses that serve as the traditional hat, dog, car, etc. from Monopoly.  The whole family plays.  I bought this for my 9 year old,  unsure of her ability to play the ""real"" monopoly and her five and a half year old sister and mom and dad all love playing it together.The down side would be the paper money and all the pieces.  We just store everything in ziplock baggies in the box after playing so as not to lose anything, and we're all set.  I'd highly recommend this game for 4+ ages.  Its a ball!!!!!"
"I am almost nineteen years old, and my mom and I think this game is fun. It's like regular Monopoly, except you go to Lunch instead of to Jail. Instead of buying property, you buy castles of pink, peach, blue, or lavendar for the characters. If you land on Ursula or Maleficent, you have to pay $2. Instead of Railroads, you have Rides that you don't buy; they are a chance to roll again."
"I bought these for a little playhouse, and they fit perfectly."
"Adorable concept but has a major flaw in its execution. Chair legs keep coming off the chairs without much effort, putting them back on is easy but they fall out again."
"My niece, she'll be eight this month loves Lalaloopsy. She wanted a sister doll for her larger one. These aren't super tiny but they're a good size. The dolls seem of decent quality and hours of entertainment for younger girls. She was super excited when she received her present. She seems to love it - so 5 stars."
A fun doll for my daughter to play with.  She has enjoyed playing with her friends with this doll and collecting other lala loopsy dolls.
"My daughter love this item. She loves all the Lalaloopsy items, and her last birthday party was themed on Lalaloopsy dolls."
"The package arrived 2 days ahead of schedule, which was only about 5 days after I ordered it. My daughter was super excited when it arrived also. The doll was still in great shape and there was no sign of wear from shipping at all. Overall, the toy was packed and shipped very well and at a reasonable price."
"I started with the ""littles"" for my neice's birthday. I then decided to get a ""few"" of them for my daughter for Christmas. As I began buying these I actually took more of an interest in collecting them. I now have several unopened in the box, I recently purchased the collector's handbook and intend to collect them all. What started as gift giving has become a hobby of mine. I love these dolls!!"
It is cutie lalaloopsy. Dress can be taken out. Shoes can be changed too. My girls love to play with it.
"She is very cute and just what we expected. My daughter, who is ten and my six year old both love these smaller versions of the lalaloopsy dolls."
"My daughter loved this doll and its accessories, it was just what she wanted for Christmas. She was very happy and excited to recieve this as a gift"
These dolls are super cute and my kids adore them!  The little sisters are a lot of fun and a great addition to use with the other dolls!  Tricky is absolutely adorable and works great with Misty...the big sis!
Picture shows doll holding wand. Good luck with that. Doll is not designed to hold wand. Hand is non-grip --
I didn't love it but my niece did.  This was a good xmas present.
lots of fun
Was a gift.
"Was bought for my niece for her birthday. She loves, did I say Loves this doll. It's so cute and just the perfect size."
My Granddaughter is really into these dolls and is trying to collect al of them.  Received in 2 days as advertised.
my grandkids luv it. got it for a xmas gift and my granddaughter luvs it. she plays with it all the time
"I bought this for my 3 yr old niece for christmas, and darn near bought myself one. These are the greatest gift for a little girl, and the descriptions of each doll is adorable."
our six year old granddaughter really loved the doll.  She has it on her bed and I think she still plays with it every day.
"The doll is cute but that is pretty much where it ends. There isnt a whole lot you can do with the ""hair"" other than comb it. The box shows all these cute styles and so did the commercial, maybe we were doing it wrong but my daughter and I were dissapointed at the lack of styles we were able to perform, and the clips pop apart very easily, not very durable. Very pricey for a doll that lays on the closet floor"
"While I don't play with this doll much...  I can tell you she is adorable!  Her hair is very easy for my 4 year old granddaughter to ""style""."
"I got this for my daughter for her birthday, and she loves it, won't put it down. Any little girl will absolutely adore it."
Mini are easy to handle.  My 4 year old loves them and plays for a long time with her collection.  She seems to be more into the little dolls compared to the big ones.
"It is a beautiful doll, girls love it, this at a very good price, therefore buy two, one for each daughter"
"My daughter had been wanting the Jewel Sparkles Lalaloopsy doll for almost a year before we got it. I did not buy it at first because everywhere I looked, the prices were exorbitant! Well over $100!  Either that or I could not find her at stores I expected to find her in. Well as I suspected prices started going down and around Christmas time. Here on Amazon the price was just over $25, a price I was definitely willing to pay for my little girl! With her wanting a ""real"" Lalaloopsy so badly ( she owned 2 of the Lalaloopsy Littles dolls, one being Trinket Sparkles, the baby sister of Jewel Sparkles, Trinket really needed her big sister Jewel! She had no experience with the original Lalaloopsy dolls that are big girls.So we ordered her, everything was of the great quality I expected, sturdy, well made clothes, just so darn cute! This character is perfect for all those little ""girly"" girls in your life, the ones who love pink and frills and dressing up and princesses. Amazon, as always was awesome! I have never been disappointed with their service, they delivered a fantastic quality product, everything in tact in a most timely fashion. Thank you so much Amazon!"
So lovely! My niece loved it & she is so happy & excited of her doll. Jewel Sparkles is her most favorite one.
Very pretty and big.  I was not expecting for this doll to be so vibrant. It was made just rigjt
"This is my daughter's favorite doll. I was unable to find it anywhere else. Not sure why these dolls are so expensive, but it was the only thing she asked for at Christmas."
"I don't understand the rage about these dolls. Hard plastic and not really able to do much with these dolls. My granddaughter loved it, but I wasn't impressed"
"I ordered this for my girlfriend for her birthday, and both of us just love it. For any collector, child, or otherwise, Lalaloopsy dolls are just wonderful."
This is a very cute doll.  She's exactly as pictured in person.  We own a couple other lalaloopsies and this one is just as cute.  There is something about these dolls that just makes you smile.  To be honest my daughter doesn't engage in play with them a ton but she loves them.  We actually didn't end up keeping Jewel Sparkle as my daughter decided on a different one that she has wanted for a long time but it's darling just the same.  If she had the chance she would of kept this one too.
My niece loves this doll. The item arrived on time and was worth the $$$....I would recommend purchasing if your kid in into the whole lalaloopsy things!!!
Jewel as all the characters on Lalaloopsy is supposed to be made of fabric. This could have been a great toy if it were made of soft materials. Why is it hard plastic? My daughter pinches her fingers in the leg/hip joints because it is made of hard plastic and is like a nutcracker. Even the hair is hard. It makes no sense. She never takes the doll with her to bed. I guess they did it to save money. Real crap if you ask me. Marketing. I plan on introducing my daughter to Raggedy Ann to hook her up with something less trendy.
My 5 year old granddaughter loved this for Christmas. She has a huge Lalaloopsy craze and she knows all their names.
Good product for the price. I would definately reccommend it. My niece loved how the dolls and their pets match.
I used these as cake decorations for a lalaloopsy themed party. They were the perfect size and were cheaper than I could buy them locally. Very great product and adorable!
"Our puppy chewed up my daughters Peanut.  When I looked for a new one to replace it, this set was only a little more than just a Peanut.  In fact the Peanut just like hers was only a few dollars less than this set.  She has several of the mini lalaloopsy and loved that she got two to replace her one that was chewed."
"My grand daugther is going to love this. When she saw it in the stores, she wouldn't put it down until i told her that we have to tell Santa to brin it. I am sure it will be a hit"
Used as a Christmas gift.  Family love it!
I gave this to my son as he has a very musical family.  I hope they will enjoy playing it over the year.
The game arrived quickly....but it just wasn't any fun.  We were disappointed.  It's too easy  to use an obscure song
This is the best game ever!! I gave two to different families for Christmas and they loved them..they told a third party who lives in Colorado about the game and they tried every option in the country to find one before Christmas and finally located one in Austin Texas!!
This was a very fun game to play with a group of your friends...the more the merrier. Music and games have always been a big part of my life and I love it when the two come to together!
Fun game for all ages. Family night or adult parties.
I cant wait to play this game.
I haven't laughed so much during a board game before. ..ever
"Different every time you play. Not for shy people, but then again it might bring them out of their shell."
"this game is so much fun, especially for a group of teens."
Dumb game
it was not what the small info indicated and it was way to complex for a 9 year old
"Played this game with extended family during the holiday visit. Laughed ourselves silly! The trigger word was ""bird"" and I launched into a rousing rendition of ""Bird, bird, bird, bird is the word."" Don't know who recorded that 60's silly song but we all were hysterically laughing. So much fun! Great family game. Really highlights the generation gap, too. BUY IT!"
"We have enjoyed playing this game.  The family members that listen to more music obviously have a little better game plan and advantage.  But, it was a great way to spend time as a family and we were laughing and all singing out strong!  The game came quickly and just as described."
"I bought this for my daughter and family for Christmas, based on the high ratings here on Amazon. They were excited to receive a family game, so we decided to play right after opening gifts. The game was confusing for the children (unless they were teamed with an adult).  It just wasn't fun to play."
Brought out intense competition in our family! All age groups can play from 6 year old to senior citizens. Very easy to learn and great fun.
"After reading reviews, I thought this sounded like a great game. It has been so much fun for our family to play.  Our 9 year old girls love it, and so does our 7 year old son.  Highly recommend this for families who enjoy board games together, especially if you like music and singing.  (No talent required!)"
Our family loves this game
"This game is meant for people who love to sing all the time, not for shy quiet people.  If your group loves to sing all the time then its for you.  Played with 8 people, 6 loved it and 2 didn't like it at all."
Got it for my 10 year old granddaughter who loves singing.  We had fun playing it.  Makes you listen to the radio differently!!
Quite fun!  We played it the day after Xmas with 7 people and it was really fun!  The only thing I would say is that it would be better with people of the same general age group as I had no idea of the songs my 11 year old grandaughter was talking about!  LOL.  I am thinking about ordering another one to have at home for my own get togethers!
"I thought Lalaloopsy Crumb's Tea Party Mini Playset would be a great addition to the Lalaloopsy Mini Sew Sweet house, but it has some issues, to say the least.  First the chairs are horrible.  The back disconnects from the bottom and all 4 legs come off.  So you end up with 6 pieces for both chairs!  The table top disconnects from the base.  Also even after the chairs are superglued they still have issues.  The chair back is pretty heavy so they can tip backwards easily.  So then the next thing. The dolls don't really fit on the chairs very well.  The base is just slightly smaller than it needs to be to be able to sit the mini's on them.  So you have to precautiously balance the dolls on it.  Such a great idea but fell short when they put it into production."
The mini dolls have a difficult time sitting and staying in the chairs and the legs of chairs fall out easily. I suggest superglue.  My daughter loves playing with it though.
This was for a 3.. turning 4.. year old. She loves it.The pieces ARE quite small. I suggest you give the child something to store all the little pieces in when they are not in play.
"This set is ridiculous. The doll cannot sit on the chairs! The chairs won't stay up by themselves. Clearly no one ever intended this to actually be played with, it's just a marketing gimmick to get your money."
the legs of the chairs do not stay in and will have to be glued in
"I'm a collector with 100+ mini's, I dont open them but I have bought a few ""loose"" dolls out of their package on eBay. I thought this would be cute to display some of my loose dolls. So I bought it and opened it and was totally disappointed. For what reason I don't know but like other reviews said the chairs come apart in pieces. The legs come off easily and are not all the same length so it's wobbly to the touch. The back of the chair also comes off and I was really disappointed to find that the dolls don't even fit in the chairs! They just slide off! I was able to make them kind of stay by having one of their hands on the table to stabilize them. Even then they fall easily if whatever they are sitting on is bumped even slightly-coffee table for example. The set is cute to look at but just falls short. The chairs just suck, that's the main thing that ruins the set. Why not make sure the doll fits on the chair and why make the chair in pieces? Stupid. I was disappointed with this item."
"Terrible chairs!!!!! They do not stay together... the four teeny legs kept falling out of the chairs and the backs off of the chairs!. Christmas morning was afoot with getting permanent glue! Now that they are together, the lalaoopsie that came with it and others so NOT stay in chairs long if at all. This is with adult hands too not just my daughters little hands.  very cheaply and poorly made but they looked cute"
I didn't realize the furniture come apart into tiny pieces.  I can't get the legs to stay in the chairs and have to break out the crazy glue.
Chairs fell apart but still cute
"I had to superglue the legs of the chairs because they kept coming off.  Once I did that, it's a very cute set."
My grandaughter loved this fits her new doll house
Very cute. And perfect for cake decoration
"This is a great little set for $12. If you wanted to buy Crumbs and her sister it cost $20plus (crazy for a 3"" doll). I bought for a xmas gift and my daughter will be sooo excited."
"My daughter Is going to love it, it's so cute!"
Good pic sew cute lalaloopsy are the best in the earth and cutest thing on the earyh i love this set THAN U MGA!!!!!!!???????????
We like Lalaloopsy mini dolls and playsets. This is a cute one but a kind of hard to play with it. The dolls easily slip down from the chair and the chairs aren't stable. The table and the tea set are okay easy to play with them.
This item is tiny. This should be the photo $40.00 later after my son opens it and looses the horse.  There is nothing Megastar7 store can do for me unless everything in tact and it's not. What a rip off.
This are lovely dolls.  My daughter loves to play for hours with this dolls for hours.  The best companions for. Little girl.
This doll goes perfectly with her big sister Misty Mysterious.  It's so cute and so durable.  Must have for your Lalaloopsy collection.
Oh my another Lalaloopsy to add to an already large collection.  Made her very happy.  Again Yay me How many more could there be ???
"Lala is awesome end of story. these loopy hair dolls are the best! my daughter absolutely loves all of them and their hair is so easy to do, doesn't actually require any sort of hair tie or barret to be styled. durable for a little girl to play with.  no knots! no knots at all! as a mom this doll is a dream!"
"I bought this doll for my 5 yo granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it.  She had it on her wish list and everywhere else the dolls were twice the price, so I was happy to find this one at such a reasonable price."
This was a very cute gift for my granddaughter and she loves it.  It is perfect for girls 3 - 6 years old...
This was such a good deal.I play with it more than my daughter does.  She picks the super hero lalaloopsy.oh well.
"Needed this doll for my 5 yr. old granddaughter and Amazon was theonly place I could get it. If you have a 5yr. old, you know exactly whichLalaloopsy Doll it had to be. Not Yellow, not red,  not green or brown, ithad to be purplish pink. Christmas was so exciting . Thank you Amazon.com."
"I bought not one but two of these for my 5 year old Grandaughter for Christmas.  She watches the TV program and wanted these in the worse way.  They came, she opened them and they held her attention for about 5 minutes.  I have to say that these are rediculous.  BIG HUGE head that is constantly lopsided.  Arms & legs that feel & look like spiders and not allot of fun to play with. They give you a comb but hair that can't be combed a few hair accessories that can clip here and there and that's the end of that story.  They are not fun to groom - they are not cuddly to hold!  Within a month they were both up for sale on ebay!  Sorry, wouldn't recommend these!"
"My 3 year old shows minimal interest in this doll.  There's nothing wrong with the doll, it just isn't that easy to play with.  She doesn't have any support of her own, her head flops around very easily.  If you're looking for a baby doll, I wouldn't get this."
My 6 year old Niece loved getting this doll for Christmas.  She is always combing and fixing her hair.  Great purchase.
It's been holding up quite nicely and the dress is pretty. You can not put too much hair in the clips but that's understandable.  Great buy.
My daughter loves to do hair and she loves lalaloopsy...so this is perfect! She put neat little braids in the hair lol
"This was purchased for the same little girl and she loves this big one too!!  She carries this one around with her too.  Thesetwo dolls were a great purchase.  I am very happy, because they were such a hit with her!!"
My 3 yr old granddaughter was thrilled. She and her cousin were comparing and enjoyed the dolls. Would buy again.
My niece loves her new Lalaloopsy loopy hair doll.  She's been wanting this for a while.  She is one very happy little girl.
"My daughter wanted this so I bought it for her.  If your daughter wants this, chances are you'll buy it for her too despite the fact that you'll think ""Seriously?  $30 for this thing?"""
"This is the full size doll, great price. Great quality and nice yarn hair that doesn't seem like it will tangle and be a mess later. Only had it a few weeks but so far daughter loves it!"
this was a gift to a four year old girl and she was sooo excited to get the gift.  It presented quite grand so the reaction was great.
My daughter asked for some mini lalaloopsy dolls for Christmas and I was pleased to find these 2 packs.  I have not noticed them in the stores.  The price was right so into my cart they went :)  She is 4 years old and will be very pleased with this present.
This doll was just like it was described. It was bigger than I expected as well. I highly recommend this.
This doll is very cute. I like the vintage designed dress and hairstyle. Cute if your girl loves Pink! ;)
"My daughter loves it. Unlike most toys now a days, it's made pretty well. It is on the expensive side, but the quality is worth it."
My daughter loved this doll! Got the doll super fast! Excellent!
A great doll at a great price wih prime shipping! Not bad for what is being charged in stores. Will look for more!
"My five year old daughter loves these dolls! I like that it has the ""birth"" date on the back and the box has what they are made from, i.e. Sparkles was made from a real princess dress."
"My 3 year old granddaughter spent  hours w/her new Lalaloopsy doll and bed right after receiving them!  She ""read"" her Tiinkerbell birthday card to her doll and tucked her in!"
"Our 4 year-old granddaughter, Mattie, wanted this doll.  Not just any Lalaloopsy but this specific doll with the crown on her head and kitty by her side.  I checked every place I knew that sold toys in the Greater Kansas City area and could not find the exact one. I didn't need to travel away from my computer because I found it right on Amazon which is usually my first go-to place to shop and found this particular doll in seconds.  I ordered it and it got it in a couple of days in amazing shape.  Too bad other places don't have the kind of customer service that Amazon has."
"this is my daughters favorite lalaloopsy, cant believe its on here for only 20. glad I did xmas shopping a month early this year"
Happy
good
Great game to add to my Monopoly collection
"When I was younger I always dreamed of moving out and being an independent adult, capable of caring for myself. Though it took far longer than I imagined it would, here I am, all alone on my own. It's wonderful, my life is mine and mine alone. I've risen out of the need of constant familial support, and in this new state I realized a few things. One of those thing's is that buying what you need to turn your house into a home isn't cheap. Another is that I greatly miss playing board games with my family. And stocking up a good game closet is quite the expensive event, that said I needed to be sure the game I pick is one that brings back memories. Because of that I decided I should purchase monopoly, one of the most fun and utterly frustrating games ever. I remember fondly all the hours spent over the board, waiting for someone to land on Baltic, or envious of whoever got boardwalk and park place. I remember how frustrated I would be over the fact that it's crazy late and here we are rolling dice, moving our metal tokens all around, and slowly going bankrupt. Craziest part is none of us are even interested in playing anymore, we'd lost our interest 20 minutes in, yet here we are 4 days later, still playing.That said I really enjoy monopoly, and This board is just right with me. It's elegantly designed with that wonderfully simplistic institutional white color, sure to fit in at any mental care facility. Another great part of this game is the new cat token, no more does your cat loving friend have to be disappointed, that's just great!"
Beautiful game.
"Nice set, has a minimalist feel to it.  Great addition to the collection."
"This is a very beautiful version of Monopoly. I am not a collector of board games. This purchase was based solely upon the aesthetics of this edition. My order arrived in a timely manner, as described by the vendor."
My husband and i love monopoly. This one is great and it looks amazing too. The game pieces are nice and the Dice aren't cheap!
"Got this as a Christmas present for my mom's house (where we play games in big groups).  The directions were rather confusing and took a long time to go through, but once we got into the game, everyone loved it.  My dad even played it and enjoyed it and getting him to play a game is tough.  It's a little different than I expected. Unlike other song games, this game doesn't include word cards; you make a list of words for others to sing.  The challenge is less in knowing songs and more in knowing who you're playing with as you have to come up with words that they're unlikely to know a song to match.  I thought for sure I'd stump my mother with ""clothes,"" but she some how managed to pull Nelly out of her head. It's a very fun game."
We have played Spontuneous with children as young as seven and adults as old as 78.  It is a great game for all ages.  It is a great game that many different generations can play together.
"Awesome game! Sounds easy but is quite challenging. Ages 15 - 55 in our family have had a blast playing it! Bought it for our music major daughter who is on her own, but going to buy a second one to have at home for the rest of the family."
I bought this to play when my family got together at Christmas and we all loved it.  Works with any genre of music and any age.  Loved it!
Somewhat confusing...we played it once & the 13 yr old was bored. I think it  should have some hint words on cards already. Almost like a karaoke list
Lots of fun! The rules are simple and it's as much of of a challenge to come up with your list as it is to try and guess someone else's! A good time for all!
"I bought the game for my 17-year-old granddaughter who loves all kinds of music. As soon as we're were done opening gifts, she wanted to play the game. She quickly read the rules to us and we got started. The game was the source of much fun and laughter. We all had a blast with it. Thank you for bringing so much enjoyment to our Christmas celebration!"
really fun!
Great! It was a lot of fun trying to come up with lyrics. I would recommend this to anyone! Will definitely play again!!
"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and we've already played it a couple of times.  The game sounded a lot of fun, but is even better than I anticipated.  It gets everyone involved, singing, and having fun.  This is a great family game or a game that could be played with friends of all ages.  Fun, fun, fun!  Like the box states.....no talent required!"
This is an awesome game. We love it.
fun game
this is really fun with a lot of people
"My family and our guests enjoy this game very much, even the reluctant players ended up belting out their favorite songs.  None of us can sing - ok, well maybe 2 out of the 8 that played had nice voices, the rest of us didn't care.  It took a little bit for us to really get into the game.  Each person gets their own paper for trigger words and then you start rolling the dice.  What I liked best about this game is the cards you can draw.  They're very fun and creative.  My 16 year old nephew had to make a rap (he loves rock so this was a challenge), and I had to sing the national anthem...by myself.  It was hilarious.  Since we had players that were 12 to 65, we had quite the range of music and songs.  Often the generations didn't know each other's music, but that's okay.This is definitely a game where the more fun you make it, the more fun it will be.  Meaning, if you just sit there and don't sing, it will probably suck.  If you're up for some mind bending challenges and a good time, bring your energy and let loose.  It's actually quite hard to think of songs on the spot while everyone else is chiming in with their own tunes.  I found my entire iPod would disappear from my mind and I wasn't very good at the personal challenges.  No worries, I still had a blast and look forward to playing again.Very creative game that will change each time you play it depending on the players.  I would recommend for teens, families, a groups of friends.  All around great game for all (little ones may be lost, but will enjoy the songs:)"
Great game!
Very disappointed! Tried playing it on thanksgiving...
Super fun game for the whole family!  We love it.
This was a gift for my grandchild.  She loves them very much.  She adored these dolls since the very first timeshe seen them in the stores.  I am handicapped so I found them on Amazon.com and purchased them.  I received them in just a few days. I really like this website. Very easy to use.
"This is one of the cutest Lalaloopseys, and my favorite boy!  I mean, Ella's favorite!  lol  I picked him up for my daughter because I thought he was just soooo endearing with his brave little sword and shield, and instead of a horse he has a pony on a stick, like a little boy should!  How adorable!  And how befitting that his pet would be a dragon!  Too cute!  Perhaps Ella's favorite thing about this whole set is that the little lalaloopsy's packaging, when opened carefully can be maintained to use as houses still, or, in Sir Battlescarred's case, a Mini Castle.  The back door has perforated spots you can carefully punch out and after you cut along all the tape and take everything out of the packaging, you can simply pop the two outer shells back together, keeping his little castle!  Ella simply adores this idea, and was happy to do so on two of the mini's I got her for Christmas, in spite of having the Lalaloopy House/traveling/Storage Case.  He differs from the female Loopsies in that his feet don't sway from side to side, he is more typical like most plastic toy's in that they bend, as do his arms, but his head turns all the way around like the rest of his friends.  No problem, just noting for the review.  Makes it easier to ride his horse on a stick I am sure, without all the flopping legs!  Definitly a cute little Knight, and has all the other mini-loopsies swooning to be rescued by him and go live in his plastic castle by the sea! (fish nightlight!)  Highly recommended to all!"
I ordered this for my 4 1/2 yr. old granddaughter for Christmas.  It came in perfect condition and was shipped quickly.  I know she will love it and she can use her imagination when playing with it and her other Lalaloopsey dolls.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.
Junk
great buy for a grand daughter when she stays overnight
"My 2 year old tried to imitate her sisters and started jumping on her bed that we purchased from a local ""always low price"" store.  It had wood slats that she busted.  I bought this because it was plastic.  It works with a military type cot held up by strong plastic frame.  Fits the mattress from her toddler bed and she loved helping put the stickers on.  Easy set up."
"Great for the price. Some holes didn't line up and the hammick is a two man job, but my granddaugter loves it."
I have twin girls and they sleep in their beds every night. They love to build forts with blankets and their beds.
"Made sturdy, easy to assemble,pretty colors, and good size for 2-4yr olds. The only problem I had was in packing the stickers for the headboard and foot board were folded and even though we cleaned the surface before putting them on they still are folding back down where they were creased. Would be better if the stickers were packed differently or sent extra stickers because it's only 2 stickers and that's the only thing that makes it a lalaloopsy bed. It has no permanent  marks that says it's lalaloopsy."
I apologize if I offend anyone but I cannot resist. What a complete piece of crap! Ordered this for my daughters birthday. It arrived damaged due to absolutely careless packaging. Thanks to a caring gentleman at Amazon a replacement was delivered in time. It too was poorly packaged. The decals were creased. Assembly was a nightmare. None of the pieces that bolt together were drilled properly. The holes would not align. I had to redrill most of them and even then I had to use my own hardware to get this thing bolted together. Poorly engineered. Poorly manufactured. Poorly packaged. Not worth a dime in my opinion.
"The parts do not fit very well and the bed is not quite stable. I returned it after couple of days. Therefore, I do not recommend it."
"GREAT, GREAT, GREAT !!!!!!Fantastic bed for my little one.She fell in love with it as soon as we were done building it and to our shock jumped in it the first night and slept through without one complaint.Highly recommend."
We got exactly what was advertised and my daughter loves her doll!  The barrettes are very sturdy and can handle think little girl hair as well.
"This was my 5 year old daughter's #1 Christmas request, and when she unwrapped it, she was overjoyed. It is packaged VERY securely, so it took a while to get it out of the box, but once out, she has been thrilled with it ever since. The hair is made of fiber and moves and comes with a comb and hair clips, which can be used for making hair styles. My daughter has other lalaloopsies that have the plastic molded hair, but was so excited when she saw this range with moving hair. The doll itself is cute, with arms and legs that move at the shoulder and hip joints, and the dress is cute, too."
Such a cute doll. I love the hair and I love the way it moves like a rag doll even though it's plastic! This is our first lalaloopsy doll and we are very pleased!
"My granddaughter had seen the ads on tv for this doll while visiting me, and asked for it. She was really excited to get it on Christmas...loves to comb her hair!"
This was the perfect Christmas gift for my friend's little girl! She absolutely loved it! Such a cute doll to play with!
My granddaughter loved this Christmas present. It was exactly what she wanted. The price was excellent and it came within two days.
"The Lalaloopsy hair doll arrived before the expected delivery date and she was in excellent condition. There was no damage to her box. She was a Christmas gift for our daughter and she loved her. She comes with little hair clips to fix her hair with, so I wouldn't recommend this toy for a very young child, unless you took the hair clips away and just let them play with the doll"
"The doll was better than what I imagined. My daughter loves it, and the price could not be beat when it was sold out in all the store."
"This doll was the one thing my daughter really wanted from Santa for Christmas and it met all of her expectations. She has had so much fun with this doll and she loves the little bourettes it came with. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that has a little daughter. My daughter takes her everywhere, even to bed! :)"
"Cute! My daughter loves to do her hair. Hair clips are a little difficult to keep track of, but not too bad."
I didn't know what this was when my 4 year old granddaughter asked for it - now I know! It's just what she wanted.
"My daughter received this for Christmas and was excited to play with the doll . The hair is hard to comb through and put barrettes/ accessories in. She has a lot of bald spots and hair has been falling out. A week later, my daughter has stopped playing with her and has not picked her up once. Glad I got a great deal on this item on amazon a month or so before Christmas!"
Bought as a Christmas gift for 6 year old granddaughter and she loves it.  Loves working with the hair and dressing her.
"My eight-year-old daughter got this Lalaloopsy for Christmas and it's been a big hit!  She comes out almost every day and has been beside the bed every night.  The doll is good quality - solid, heavy plastic parts with brush-able hair and clips for fun hairstyles.  We all are very happy with the purchase."
My granddaughter turns 5 next week and she absolutely loved this as a Christmas gift.  She doesn't want to part with it.  She's a girly girl and just loves being able to style the hair.
"Cute little doll that is sure to charm the heart of any little girl or doll collector.  This is the first doll that our granddaughter has had, and she loves and sleeps with this ""Loopy Hair dolly."""
Santa brought this today. The hair is already falling out on floor.Flimsy and cheap for too much $$$$$.Pass on this toy.
"Granddaughter will love it too! She's been saying she wants it for christmas, and Santa left it under the tree for her. :D"
"great prize!! Was delivered very fast!!!  It is a BIG SIZE DOLL, regular size doll, NOT A MINI ONE like someone's comment said. VERY HAPPY!!!!"
"This is the prettiest edition of Monopoly.  I love the white and silver board and white gaming pieces, but this game was folded into four.  The packaging is more on the square side.  The original game comes with in a rectangular package and the board is folded in two. The pearl edition's board is folded into four with a split a quarter of the board, going right through Pennsylvania Railroad.  Since the game is new, the split sticks out like a sore thumb and is a little cumbersome to navigate the pieces.  I might tape underneath the board for cohesiveness.  All in all since the sticker price from Kohl's says $29.99, I'm okay with the board being the way it is.  I might try to get the original version as well.(From what I can tell, from when I purchased the board a couple of weeks ago, the $7.99 price here on Amazon has been the best, beating out Ebay and other vendors.)"
It's great Item for the collector of Monopoly sets.
"I love monopoly,and besides having alot of this game. the design is so unique  and the game is fun. It's a keeper for sure.very educational and very entertaining."
This is something that every collector of Monopoly Games must have.  Came well packaged and fast.
I THINK ITS VERY NICE FAMILY WISE AND FUN TIME FOR THE KIDS .
"Literally, they pay my paycheck. hehe.. I had this given to me on a lark this Christmas. It's really a marketing ploy disguised as Monopoly. But the thing is it's a GOOD marketing ploy. They want you to become familar with the new layout of Toys R Us that was completed in 2001, when this game was completed. It's an excellent game however, and really fun for a worker from TRU. I think unless you're a huge TRU fan or you've visited the Times Square store, I would say elect for a different version of the game."
"Perfect for my power puff girl!!! There is such a limited amount of merch for ppg, and usually it's so expensive! This game was a huge hit with my 6 year old!!!!  :-)"
Beware -I ordered the Ember Flicker Flame doll from Yo Yo for $11.99 and instead received an accessory pack of just the silly hair for a MINI lalaloopsy doll.  Guessing they have the items mixed up in their inventory and the $11.99 price is meant for the accessory - not the doll.
My nieces  little girl was so thrilled with the lalaloopsy doll---she just could not  put it down.  She was so busy fixing her hair. and playing beauty shop.  The perfect gift for a 6 year old---making me the best aunt ever--love that..  Pat Madden
So cute. My daughter loves it. Very fast shipment.
"so heavy her weight is more than the Shipping Weight: says  1.2 pounds = about 0,550 kg but it weight 1,2 kg"
I am a little disappointed with Lalaloopsy toys. With a 5 year old and a 2 year old I have to be careful what I buy my older daughter so that it doesn't have anything dangerous for my 2 year old. I would think we have a fairly common age gap in our children. So to make products that little girls want that come with a ton of parts a toddler could swallow is bad business I think. I'm going to buy pipe cleaners to attached instead of 30 small pieces and I'm sure my daughter will have just as much fun and not have to try and find all those small parts.
"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter. This is a cute doll but the hair pieces are a little hard to snap together. The carrying case is cardboard so i'm sure it wont last long. I gave this toy a 3 star rating because it is really cute and durable but I don't think the carrying case will last long, and the pieces are a little hard for a child to snap together."
Its cute but stopped working on Day 2:(. My daughter was disappointed because this was a part of her Christmas present and it matched her Lalaoopsy bedroom decor. I will be sending it back.
Bought this for my grand daughter.  She loves it!!
Good value
My daughter loves them all though they material is rather rough. Patterns on sheets are one-sided. Price is right for a five-year old's bed.
"THIS SET IS VERY NICE,VERY COLORFUL AND GOOD QUALITY.MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES IT! I WOULD PURCHASE THIS SET AGAIN.I RECOMMEND IT"
"This is fun, fun family game.  Both older and younger.  The younger ones actually make fun of the old folks songs."
Much harder than implied
A family game fun for all ages to join in and share the joy of music.
"This looks to be a most fun and enjoyable game. We bought it as a ""stocking-stuffer"" for Christmas for our adult children and their spouses... A+"
"We purchased this for a gift for a 67-year-old grandmother. Three generations had a blast playing this game together. The songs sung were an eclectic mix ranging from alternative rock and rock and roll to show tunes and folksy singer song-writers. It's a high energy game that is a lot of fun and a great way for friends and family to learn more about each other based on their musical preferences. Definitely recommend playing with at least 4 people. After playing the board game, we developed a new game for long car trips - the kids choose a word and the parents have to think of song with that word in the lyrics and play it from our music collection. A great way to get the kids interested in listening to ""OUR"" music."
This was purchased as a Christmas gift and I won't be using the game
"The game is very fun but there is one suggestion that I would like to make.  I think the rules should state that a song cannot be used more than once in a game.  Some of our people reused songs and that made it uninteresting and less challenging.  Other than that, it was great fun."
Very fun game for all ages!
"Bought this for a game night with 12 year old girls, and they all LOVED it!  Easy to figure out, super fun to play, no arguing - just lots of singing, dancing and giggles.  They all can't wait to play again!  Would be great for mixed ages, too (adults, kids, grandparents).  Great purchase!"
fast ship very happy
"Gave this game to my niece (8 years old) for her birthday and she liked it, but the rest of the family LOVED it. It's nice to have some people from the same generation playing so that they recognize each other's songs- for my niece it was good that her 9 year old sister was playing because they knew a lot of the same songs. Overall fun game and we look forward to playing it at Thanksgiving time with the whole family. :)"
not that much fun ...
"Played with our 2 granddaughters and we laughed a lot!  It brought out the ""silly"" in all of us."
"I initially didn't think I would have fun with this game since I'm what you call 'lyrically challenged', but it ended up being a lot of FUN. It's super easy to play. This is definitely a must have for game nights with friends or family!"
"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for this year so we have not used this yet, However it looks like it will be a lot of fun!"
I bought this game for my 9 year old granddaughter. All five of the grandchildren (ages 5 to 11) LOVE this game. They have gotten it out repeatedly to play with and without adults. (They have quite the musical repertoire!) The rules are simple and game play is very entertaining.
"We could not be more pleased with this game.  It was perfect for Family Game Night.  We had players ages 62, 38, 11, & 8.  It took a few minutes for the littlest to get the hang of what she was supposed to do; we had to play an 'example round'.  But once it clicked, she took off like a champ and almost beat us all.One thing that I really appreciate about this game is that it spans all generations and genres.  Our game had Sinatra, Bon Jovi, Ariana Grande, Smokey Robinson, TV jingles from the 50's, Broadway showtunes- you name it, we had it.  It also teaches you about each others' tastes.  I was so surprised at some of the older songs my girls knew!!The best praise I can give this game is the fact that no one wanted to stop playing it, even though we had three other brand new games to try out.  Spontuneous is hands down the best family game we've ever played."
Haven't had a chance to play the game but once.  Seemed like a lot of fun!  Will no better once we get the whole family together again for the holidays!
"It's pretty awful. Starting with the box itself, the bed that is pictured is computer rendered and not exactly like the product. My more serious complaints are as followed;-Only about half of the parts were labeled, and the difference between the 1-1, 1-2, H-1, and H-2 pieces are so miniscule that I didn't realize I had them mixed up until I tried attaching a bed rail.-There was a dent in one of the metal legs and there were already a few stress marks in the plastic pieces.-Building it was difficult and took a lot longer than we felt it should have.-The holes wouldn't line up properly for the screws.-We had to hammer the ends of the poles so that they would align with the headboard and footboard legs-Several lock-nuts were stripped and couldn't be used. Because of this, only one of the bed rails could be put on.-Fully built, it was slightly larger than advertised, leaving the mattress I already had loose in the frame, and with the fabric piece, leaves gaping holes exposed for little limbs to get stuck in.-The fabric piece adds to the difficulty of construction and ripped due to being too small.I had to do too much to make this bed frame work for my liking, and I am scared that it wont be able to handle my active 17-month-old. This is not going to be permanent, and will be replaced as soon as possible."
"this arrived right on time.  It came with clear instructions,  I was able to put it together,  even with 2 little girls hanging on me.  my granddaughter is very happy."
I bought this bed thinking it was purple like in the picture above but I got it and opened it up and its hot pink not that disliked the color just thought it would have been nice to know the color they were gonna send me when i bought it ;)
Granddaughter loves collecting shopkins.
This was cute but the one I received did not fit together properly and when I called little tikes I got a terrible response from customer service and ended up returning it to amazon. The lid is also not attached to anything so at my house it would have likely just ended up on the floor all the time.
Very cute toy storage
Loved it
My little girls happy with he lalaloopsy  toy box . Easy to put toy box together took me 5 min.
Great colors and you could never go wrong with tiny tots
This was a gift for my granddaughter....It was perfect!
Good item buyer was satisfied
Awsome my kids love of it and easy to put together.
"Our granddaughters love it, age 4 likes to sit & read on it and toddler 11 months loves to crawl to it and is very proud of herself when she pulls herself up to a standing position.  Nice & sturdy and sure to last for a long time."
I gave this toy box as a gift to my nephew and his wife for their 1st baby and they are thrilled!  It is well made and sturdy.
"Great item and super fast shipping, thanks."
Excellente ! My daughter love chair
Love that it is plastic and easy to wipe down. I used this in my daughter's nursery when she was young to hold stuffed animals under the window. Now it is in the play room and gets much love.
"What can I say?  It's a great toy box, easy set up, and within few weeks, my granddaughter learn to lift the top, and set it in the ""up"" position. It is a great design, and even full, easy to carry and move to room to room.  I bought it for three reasons!  1. A place for toys.  2. A great barrier in between couches.  3.  Adorable!"
"Toy box shown appears to be purple.  The one I recieved is deep pink, orange and green.  Colors complement the Fiesta Favorites Kitchen by Fisher Price!  It seems very durable.  Other toy boxes look like they easily scratch, dent, and show damage.  So, I'm happy to have found this design...  I won't have to cringe everytime kids toss toys inside.Assembly was fast and easy.  It took longer to find the power drill than to put it together.  This is a well-thought-out design for kids.  And, its made in USA"
"Unlike the other Lalaloopsy dolls, this one's coloring was more subdued, and didn't quite stand up to the others I had bought for my other granddaughters.  I kept it, but probably shouldn't have...."
"I got my wife one of this doll, yeah you heard it right, my wife who is 30ish of age. She haven't opened it to play with it, she just loves how the doll looks like. This specific one I bought I donated to my local church as a gift to an outreach program."
Pleased with my purchasel which came at a reasonable price.  Hopefully my niece will be happy as well this Christmas..
This is the cutest doll. She's just the right size and everything came with her to make playtime a funtime for my granddaughter. I would recommend this doll to anyone who is into the Lalaloopsy dolls.
"Bought this for a Christmas present for my 5 year old.  She had the older La La Loopsy with the hard head, she hardly ever played with it.  Hoping she will play with this one since it has hair she can make pretty and she loves doing hair.  Will update this a couple weeks after she gets it on Christmas."
"Cute, great hair, lots of fun to style the hair! Hair seems like nice yarn hair that will not ball up or frizz out. Seems like it will hold up much better than most doll hair. My four year old loved this for her birthday."
this is for my granddaughter for Christmas this year.  she will love this doll with the real hair and all.  thanks
a christmas present for my little one. will not be able to give an adequate review once my baby receives it
The hair clips are very hard to open by adult and definitely not by 4 yr old. But she loved the colors and the hair so it was a hit there but disappointment that she cannot work clos without assistance
My grandaughter loved the doll bed. It was the right size for her dolls. For me the assembly was a snap.
My grand daughter loves these Lalaloopsy dolls!  She is very happy with her Lalaloosy dolls.  Every little girl should have one!!
"She is super adorable. My niece loves her. She has lots of hair for her to learn to how to braid. It does not tangle up and get snarls like conventional doll hair. She loves that!! The 6 clips are adorable (my niece wears one on her own finger, puts one on her doll's wrist and shares the clips with her doll and her own hair. She finds this a very fun toy and enjoys it using her imagination. Unlike another review, stating ""the doll doesn't do anything"" we find that the doll is well made and does a lot by encouraging the use of imagination and actually creating a fun playtime."
Bought this item on Amazon.com. Very nice doll and my Granddaughter loves her. I would recommend this item to anyone who has a little girl..
It is a great doll my granddaughter loves it I would recommend it to any girl. The price is great
"Absolutely adorable and well packaged upon arrival. Price was right. Will be loved on Christmas morning.Best price I could find as well. It was a win, win for me and my grand nieces!"
"I had no idea about Lalaoopsy until we saw a commercial and my daughter freaked out.  Gave this to her as a ""big sister"" reward for helping with her brothers and she hasn't put it down since."
"I started my Christmas shopping with this doll and it is the regular size doll at a GREAT price! you can't get this doll anywhere cheaper, but you better hurry before the price goes up for the holidays!"
"This lalaloopsy was very reasonable and I know our grand daughter is going to love it. Easy to shop on here, love the shipping its fast and toys are durable! Just read discription!"
"My daughter fell in love with the complete bedding set. I bought her the sheet set, hoping it would satisfy her, and I'm glad it has, because the quality on this set is pretty low. The box says ""cotton rich,"" and I guess that 60% cotton counts, but it feels like polyester through and through. The sheets are thin, plastic-feeling, and not stitched terribly well. Also, the pink color bled a bit the first couple washes. I will say in their favor, these sheets dry quickly and fold with few wrinkles. But that's faint praise, and we know it. If you can distract your child from these sheets, I think you'd be better off spending more on something 100% cotton, even if the licensed characters aren't there."
Very very beautifull
"two  young grand daughters loved the books, showed them to their ""kids"" who are the dolls I gave them for their birthdays.  Not found in any toy store around here"
Fun games and entertainment for my little one. She just loves the activities that this book has to offer and I do too.
"I thought this was going to be a large floor coloring pad, it's not. Just a regular coloring book. It's not even very thick."
"It says Giant Coloring And Activity Book, but it is not.I thought giant, meant it was one of the really big books.It is the size of what you would pay $1 or $2 for at the dollar store and the content is no better. I feel ripped off. I paid $6.99 for it. Don't waste your money like I did."
Cute toy I suppose.  My granddaughter likes them.
Tiny but cute.  Christmas present.
Very satisfied
Awsome my kid loves shopkins.Our target does not sell these anymore.
The service and goods were great
A bit pricey but my daughter loves it.
"Bought the Sew Royal Castle for our 4 year old daughter for Christmas. Decided to buy it through Amazon as it was significantly cheaper than at Walmart at the time. It is so cute and she absolutely loves it. It comes with the Castle \, which has plenty of room for extra Lalaloopsy tinies to visit, a carriage, a pony, a pillow with a little glass slipper,  a tiny fan, a prince and princess."
Exactly as described.
"This is made for the mini or tiny Loopsies. I was glad it wasn't too big. It can hold a lot of the loopsies inside it, but they can fall out of the windows, during transportation. Not a big deal. My girl loved it!!"
got it as a gift. small parts so dont give it to children under 3 or small dogs
Daughter loves it
"Smaller than I thought it would be, and already lost somewhere in the depths of our toy box.  Was fun while it lasted!"
"We purchased this as a last minute addition to our Christmas gifts for our 5 year old daughter.  We happened to have passed it in a store a couple weeks before Christmas, and we soon heard ""I really want that Lalaloopsy castle"" non-stop.  As the store was sold out, I hopped on Amazon.  I found it at a great price & it has quickly become the ""favorite"" toy from this past Christmas!  Our daughter literally plays with it, and the extra Tinies we purchased on a whim, every single day!  I love that it doubles as a storage container for the extra Lalaloopsy Tinies as well.  (It makes clean up a breeze!)  We really couldn't be happier with this; it's darling and fun & keeps our daughter occupied for quite awhile.  It does come with 3 Lalaloopsy figures, but it's definitely more fun with more!  I recommend buying an extra set of tinies!"
Pretty boring on the inside.  My daughter likes it though.
My granddaughter loved this find Millie.
5 of us played: 70 year old to 8 year old. Most fun we had for the week.
"Good concept but don't need the board.  We found it more fun to create teams, have each team create hit list and play without the board or cards.  We did use the timer and otherwise followed the ""rules"" of the game."
Love the game! I even had my musical theatre class play it without the board and we had a blast!
Great
"This was a lot of fun for our whole family on vacation!  We had a ringer who kept winning, but it was still fun!"
Very funny and hilarious.
"This game is a bit of a paradox: there are moments of high interaction, and moments of intense silence as people try to think of song lyrics. Overall it went over great with our game group, but I think there may need to be a couple of rules tweaks. The problem we had was people singing over each other and then trying to figure out who started first and had enough words. We started giving points to everyone that sang just to keep it from getting too cut throat. This is a great game for game night when people arrive and/or leave at different times."
I got this game for my workplace.  I work in a retirement community and we had a blast playing this with the residents.  It is a lot of fun.
Can't figure out the directions. But also can't wait to play. I believe it Will be fun.
"This would be a great game if I didn't play with people who know songs that have the word ""beluga"" in them.  I mean seriously, who uses songs so obscure you can only find the lyrics in a cassette case from 1982?I need new friends!"
"We bought this game and have had a ton of family fun learning how to play. It's fun for all ages and it also makes you think while you're having fun! Fantastic game, highly recommend!"
"I bought it for my kids and grandkids and they are having a great time playing it! Thank you so much, the description really sold it to me."
"Played with our family and had a blast. Quick and easy to set up. I like that the games can go fast. I can see younger children having a challenge with this game as it does require you to remember songs you heard. However, I did win on Twinkle Twinkle, Itsy Bitsy Spider and Jingle Bells. So it's really not that hard. It was also great to see my teenagers play with their grandmother - we got Lady Gaga on one end and Old Black Magic on the other. I could see this come out at our next adult party for an all play version! Great Job!!!!"
"I recently purchased the game Spontuneous...and played it for the first time last Monday and enjoyed every minute of it....one of my friends even called the next day complaining because she woke up in the middle of the night thinking about the words and songs that she couldn't think of while we played and couldn't get back to sleep!!  The part I loved is that everyone breaks out into the song and then we talk about what we were doing when that particular song was popular. We live in and Active over 55 community...it was perfect for us.  I received ""Encore"" as a gift some years ago and have beaten that one almost to death.  We play everywhere and many times in restaurants, other patrons would come by to learn about it.  I expect the same will happen with Spontuneous.. Thank you for the invention and kudos to Amazon for a very prompt deliverySincerely,Judy McKinstry"
From the first moment we played this game we laughed and enjoyed ourselves immensely! Thank you for creating an awesome game!
"This game is a hit at family reunions and on game nights. Unique game-when I pull it out, pretty much no one has heard of it, but they all end up loving it. Breaks up the monotony of playing the same old games over and over."
"This game was the hit of the family gathering at Christmas. You must be quick at recalling music and bold in singing. Our family thorougly enjoyed the game. Now, when the family gather together, that is the first game that is requested to play."
Just too cute!  Very well made.  Fast delivery.
Absolutely adorable! My three year old princess loves her.
Super cute!!!!
i bought this toy for my granddaughter and she loves it
Cute Lalaloopsy Baby....fast shipment
"Very cute, my 3yr old loves it!"
She is absolutely adorable. My daughter is going to love it!!
It is a very good doll
Wonderfull
"My seven year old daughter begged and begged, and yes she loves Tippy baby."
Nice doll.
I truly love this doll it's adorable and my six year old daughter would love to add this to her collection of lalaloopsy babies set!!! I hope they bring it out again :-)
"So incredibly cute! Baby Tippy has several wonderful details like, printed ballet slippers, an attached tutu on her pantaloons, and a thick lined knit cap with swan embellishments! Very happy with this doll!"
Mea???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Everything is perfect!  Thank you!!!!
Perfect!
This (very) large plush doll is my five year old's most beloved Christmas present! It is almost as big as she is!
My daughter loved it. I dropped the ball and ordered it a after her birthday but it got delivered on a Sunday which kind of made up for it.
I purchased this for my little sister and she really likes it. It's very large and it's quite amusing to see her play with it.I really can't emphasize how large this product actually is.
Love this! WAY bigger than expected!!! She has a zipper in the back of her head to hold a small blanket or a few toys. Maybe some lalaloopsy littles? :)
Was about twice the size I was expecting. Most of that is head...not neccesarily a bad thing. Just stating the facts. There's a zipper in the back of her head that is supposed to be a place for pajamas or something (per the tag) but there's no way pajamas would fit in there. Maybe a toothbrush or money or something. I'm not really to fond of the feature personally. But eh..kids might like it. (Going to be a gift)
My daughter loves this doll. She wants to bring it every where. She will sleep all night in her bed since we have purchased it because she can snuggle up to it.
My daughter loved this doll. This doll was a great size for her to play with and sleep with. Exceptional price.
I bought this Pillowtime pal to match our granddaughters Lalaloopsy comforter.  It makes a cute decoration on her bed. I also bought some Lalaloopsy wall stickers.
My cousin loves Lalaloopsy and donuts!
"Once we received this doll we were happy with the product and we know that our daughter will love it.  However, I should mention that at first we were sent the mini-version of the doll.  After reading other reviews, I made sure to double check that I was ordering the regular size one.  I did confirm that it was the normal doll, but upon arrival I was sent the mini-version.  We contacted Amazon and at first they were just going to refund our money so we could repurchase it, but the product had increased in price.  However, after some discussion they did state that they would replace the item for us and we received it two days later."
I ordered this doll as a gift for my daughter for Christmas.  Got it today and it is the mini!  What a hassle it is to send this back.  Don't waste time ordering this......
This was the correct large lalaloopsy! Don't be misrepresented by others comments o Great deal on the doll! Thank you
"For the other reviewer who was very annoyed over the company trying to rip people off..they are selling the full size doll. The price should of given that little fun fact away. They do show the mini doll but they are definitely selling the big doll. The mini versions of this doll are around $10.00- relax, have a cup of decaf and happy shopping!"
This listing is showing TWO different dolls. The mini loopy hair and the regular sized one! Which one is it? Who are you trying to rip off???  op
Great selection of Shopkins Season 2!
Super
My 4 year old plays this like a pro! Easy to understand intructions and simple game. Everything came on time as expected and the family really enjoyed the option to play a card game instead for a little more challenge.
"Monopoly Empire is a very interesting game. Object of game is to collect the billboards on the board to put on your game piece. First person to fill their piece wins. Sounds easy, not so much, there are other players trying to stop you. Good fun for all ages, but there are a lot of small pieces so kids should be supervised."
"As a parent I want to play games with my kids but when they say ""Let's Play Monopoly"" I look at the clock and sigh...this is a fast paced version that also opens up conversations about corporations, businesses, advertising....etc...great addition to game night."
"The game is easy to understand, easy to play, and does not take an extensive amount of time to finish.  Its great for Family Time!"
"Big hit for my 8yr. old nephew.  Although I still prefer the original Monopoly, this version definitely appeals to today's kids and maintains most of the features of the original game."
"I enjoy this version of Monopoly; it is streamlined and simplified.  Goal is to buy billboards (aka properties) to fill your tower; the more expensive billboards are longer, and if you get it to the top you win.There are little twists:-One of the dies has the ""1"" replaced with a ""swap"" so you can choose to swap your top billboard with someone else's top billboard-- if you decide not to you just use the other die number to move-Income tax has been replaced with Rival Tower tax (you can put an opponent's top billboard back on the board)-Luxury tax replaced with Tower tax (you put your top billboard back on the board).-Free parking allows you to pay $100 to go to any spot on the board.-It costs $100 to get out of jail, $50 if you fail to roll doubles 3x.  There is no Railroad spot, so it's 9 spaces on each side rather than 10.-When you land on someone else's property, you pay them their Tower worth (higher the taller your tower is); if you pass Go, you collect your Tower worth.-If you can't afford to pay something you lose or give your billboard instead without giving your remaining cash, so it is impossible to go negative.-If you get a monopoly, you get one free extra 1 space Office billboard.  You can also purchase a 1 space Office billboard at any time for $500.-Empire cards are ""save and use later cards"" (like ""Just say no"" or ""Hostile takeover"").-Utilities have 4 one slot billboards that you can purchase if you land there, but no one gets charged for landing there.-There are only $50, $100, and $500 bills.I played it with my wife and my four year old daughter even though the game wasn't made for someone that young; I had to read the empire/chance cards to her and show her when to use them and tell her what bills to hand the bank when she wanted to buy stuff, and even walked her through an auction (""I want to pay $50, will you pay $100? etc) but she enjoyed it (and won both times, with a tiny bit of our help).  I expect that it will eventually help her learn simple math (moving with the die rolls, paying with simple $50, $100, and $500 bills).  So basically a lot of it is luck (but so is the regular monopoly), but it doesn't matter as much with this version because the games lasted less than 30 minutes each so you're not stuck feeling bad or wanting to quit if you're losing badly.  The empire cards add a little bit of decision-making and excitement to the game.  I did miss organizing piles of cash (including $1 bills) in the old monopoly and buying houses and hotels (instead in this game if you get a monopoly you get another tiny single slot billboard for free).The bonus card game is basically an exact copy of Pit.  Never played the game before but searched for keywords online regarding gameplay rules ""yell out what you want"" and Google returned Pit.  I read the Pit rules and realized it was the exact same game even down to Bear and Bull (Empire and Go to Jail) cards.  Instead of commodities you have Empire property and colors.If I could do it again, I might invest in just the base Monopoly Empire game and buy Monopoly Deal instead because Monopoly Deal is just awesome.  But I hear Pit is a fun game.  I would even consider getting Monopoly Millionaire instead because it seems more complex and involved.  But Monopoly Empire is so simplified even my 4 year old had fun playing it.  I'd imagine she wouldn't do quite as well with Monopoly Classic or Millionaire."
Great game and terrific  service my son loved it
Bought it for my boyfriend who is a huge AC fan as a gift. He absolutely loved it and I was tempted to keep it for myself. Well worth purchasing if you like Assassin's Creed.
We frequent a nearby restaurant. After finding out that our regular waitress was going to be in the clink for a couple days due to stalking her ex-boyfriend (no joke) we got one of these and left it with the tip. Priceless.
Great product.
I loved this balloon for my daughters lalaloopsy birthday party. I couldn't find anything like this locally. Shipped quickly. Thank you.
Purchased as a gift for my grand-daughter. It is a cute puzzle. I really don't know how much can be said about a puzzle
Perfect for the birthday party.
"I ordered two, one was great, the other only stayed inflated for a couple of days. I usually get two solid weeks out of a Mylar.  It stayed inflated for the event, but my girls didn't get as much enjoyment as usual out of it."
"Super tiny, the dolls actually don't stay in it because there are windows so it's not really a ""case"" - but aside the extra work for me she loves it!  For what it is, seems very overpriced however."
Love ir
the kid really loved the castle so very much very happy
Very happy with our purchase!
Sew cute! My girlie loves it as well as her tinies:)
"Super cute - great, more lalaloopsy to buy!"
My 3yr old just loves this little castle! I think the Tinies are ADORABLE. Tiny but adorable. Easily lost but we found the Prince! No worries! I will buy her other playsets of these. She carries this one around and wants more to go with it so she can build a little town!
Granddaughter loves it!
My children love it!
This is a really cute doll. My daughter keeps her on her bed all the time.
ok
"Grate toy and came packaged as advertised and look better then in the pics.I will definitely bay from this supplier again.Thank you for your toy, my kids are made about her."
"My little girl loves Lalaloopsy Dolls and has quite a collection of them. She has more than 30 of the full-size dolls, 5 of the littles, and a dozen or so of the minis. I bought this doll from Target several months ago and she is beautiful! She is absolutely the prettiest of all of the Lalaloopsy Dolls! The colors are so pretty and sweet! My favorite by far!"
When I received the doll she looked dirty in some places! And this close to Christmas I didn't want to send her back and not be able to get the one my child wanted!
"Scratched and dented. True to picture, but scratched in some places so badly that I had to sharpie the color in."
I bought it for my 9 year old niece.  She loves lalaloopsy dolls however this one is special.  It was worth 100% all the trouble to bring it my country.
my kid loves it loves it becase it has sparcly hair. and a bow.its so cute. i love it's wings
This is a hard to find item and we wanted it for my neice who's birthday is the same as Cloud E Sky's. She absolutely loves the doll and I couldn't be any more happy with it and how quickly it was shipped!
My girls love these!
Cute
Everything was excellent
Great product.
best toys for girls!
I wanted to name my daughter mari # lalaloopsy insiders
They are awesomely adorable!
PERFECT FOR MY DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY CAKE!
"We already LOVED Mari Golden Petals as a full-size doll, but she's super cute as a mini, too. We have both versions -- this one and the one with more yellow on her skirt. Super cute! One of my favorites!"
"I purchased this game when it was just fresh on the market and have had more fun playing it with both family and friends.. We have a large family and still.....every time we have a get together it's the first game on the table.....SPONTUNEOUS!  The laugher and smiles that come from this game are infectious and when we wear this one out we'll be buying another.  Great for gifts! I would highly recommend this game for both adults and children....you'd be surprised what songs kids come up with, which is half the fun.  LOVE THIS GAME......SPONTUNEOUS!"
"Played during family gatherings for the holidays. Better if age groups are not so different, I think. Think another game we have that is similar may be more fun."
This is an imaginative game that invites participants to sing and jog your musical memory. Great for birthday and family dinners.
Hilarity ensues when one gathers around to play Spontuneous ! I have never once been bored or disappointed no matter what. Played once at 4th of July picnic and a 90 year old man won over and over. He knew a hymn for every trigger word! So much fun to spark conversation and family or friend time. Best thing ever is knowing the inventor and having a sense of pride in having watched him grow up and be successful! Well done all who are a part of Spontuneous.
We absolutely loved this game.  I always have a song in my head.  My friends tease me because I burst into song whenever I hear any phrase that reminds me of a song....which is all the time!  This game brings the songs in your head to life.  It's competitive and silly and makes you think while you laugh your head off.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have fun in a group setting.  Awesome :)
"Spontuneous is a great game to play with your kids, friends, family....your kids don't know the songs from your era, but then you don't know the words from their era....so we all have a chance....The best thing about the game is when it's over, you keep thinking of ""trigger"" words to use next time...it's a kick when you have to draw a card....you may have to stand up and sing the Star Spangled Banner as I did...but everyone else had to stand with their hands over their hearts too...really fun!!!1  My rule.  Buy One!!!"
"This is the perfect game for all ages to play!  It was so fun to play and to see that anyone, no matter what genre of music they like, could play and have fun at it!  It is a favorite to play at all types of gatherings we have."
"You're sitting in the living room, surrounded by great company. Your friend flips over a 15-second hourglass. The room erupts in a cacophony of song - lyrics are distinguishable only if you are watching the lips of those around you.In another turn, the hourglass is flipped, and a dead silence ensues. It's interrupted only by the crickets outside and the noise of your brother scratching his forehead - wracking his brain to come up with a song that features the trigger word played.Such is the roller coaster of inspiration and baffling Spontuneous evokes.This game is awesome. It's uproariously funny, it stimulates the brain and your working memory, and most importantly - it provides a great, fun, and connected experience for you and your family and friends to share.If you are competitive and like fair play, I recommend vetoing a few of the game cards that come along with it, as occasionally they are profoundly discouraging (""You lost your voice while on tour - go back to start""). But if you're all about the spontaneity of the moment - dive right in!Another fantastic game that is very similar to this is the classic Encore. Neither are superior, as they both have their strengths.If you're interested in a single solid game format and the social dynamic of being able to stump and confuse your fellow players - go with Spontuneous. If you're interested in countless variations of play and an evening full of song: go with Encore.Sing on!"
The game was okay - not great - but okay - we all played the game with my granddaughter over the holidays.It was a little too adult for her.
"This Game is AWESOME! It turns a gathering of friends into a raucous roaring laughing great time to be remembered. Best board game ever! Works for everyone, since YOU make up the triggerword players can use their type (rock, country, rap christian) of music to play! Even different generations can play together. Wonderful, can't say enough good things about the game or the company!"
"my family, from my 13-year-old granddaughter up to myself, have really enjoyed this game! Everyone brings a different ""data base"" of music to the table, and it doesn't matter. There are no ""right"" or ""wrong"" answers, as long as you can come up with a lyric that matches the given key word.And sometimes my kids are surprised by what's in MY data base : D"
"Very cute little dolls. The package is reusable as a doll house. Watch out for the tiny parts, not suitable for toddlers. That's the reason the appropriate age starts at 4 years old. If you happen to have pets be careful as well. The dolls are well made. Really adorable. I got a few of these mini dolls for the Christmas stockings, I can tell the girls are going to love it!"
Great Deal
"This is one of my daughter's favorites. The doll and pet are very cute, and we love the donut theme."
"Remember they are cute, plastic, and easy to lose. We need a big box for them. They are so cute. The little bear is separate so you have to watch out for them."
I feel so lucky to spend so little to make 3 little girls so happy.  I have been getting them the mini lalaloopsy of their choice for each of the smaller holiday's.  They love them.  They are so excited to get them.  I can't believe something so inexpensive has them this exited.
"It seems to be okay so far, my niece loves it. I thought the price is pretty reasonable. I would buy another one."
She has become one of the favorite of the millions we have at home. It seems like the dolls that come with more accessories have less details.
I Love Lalaloopsy Dolls of any Kind. They are very Pretty Little Dolls. YOU will Like Them also! They are so colorful.
My granddaughter loved it!!!She loves Lalaloopsy doll and this is different than anything she has in her vast Lalaloopsy stock!
"My daughter loves this toy. Peanut is her favorite. The shipping however leaves a lot to be desired. The package came beat up and opened on one side, and barely hanging on on the other. I did not need to open it to get to Peanut, she just slid right out. She came shipped USPS. It looked like someone had decided they wanted to see inside. I have ordered many times from Amazon and this is a first for me. On a positive note, Peanut came ahead of schedule."
"Everything was as expected. However, out daughter was not happy with the soft doll. So, if you child is aware of the ""hard"" dolls they may be disappointed by the soft doll."
my baby girl has just begun her lalaloopsy infatuation and I began her collection with this. She loves it and has it in bed with her everynight. The fact that it is soft makes it much easier to sleep with. its so cute.
"the recipients thoroughly enjoyed this doll - i don't quite get the rage but then again, this doll isn't made for me.  girls were happy w/their new doll and are enjoying it."
This was my granddaughters first soft doll.  She is going to be 2.  She was very happy to get Peanut big top as a gift.
"Let me start off by saying that I don't get these dolls. They are expensive and small (even though it is called ""Peanut Big Top""). However, the item is not for me. It was for my 4 year old niece. She squealed with delight when she saw the doll. 4 out of 5 stars because this looks more like a $10 toy."
"These dolls are adorable! I ordered extra in case and ended up giving this one to an 8 yr old. I thought it would be too young for her, but all my nieces and my 3 and 5 yr old daughters really loved them. The little animal that comes with each doll is also a good size, not too hard to find amidst other tiny toys that are always getting lost! Great buy!"
I love the dool...but its the child  that have do said if she liket ou not... but ist very cute
Very good quality and my daughter loves them. Soft but very well constructed. Amazon has a good selection and great prices.
This balloon was a big hit with the kids at my daughter's party.  Some of the guests wanted to take them home.  Very cute!
Thank you! Really liked it! Our daughter was happy!
"When I originally purchased this book I thought that it was kind of a 'fashion design' book where the girl could take stickers and decorate her own LaLaLoopsy characters. That is not the case. This book has an array of stickers and each page has numbers where the stickers go. You use the stickers to complete the pictures on the pages.I purchased this book for my middle foster daughter for her birthday. She loves LaLaLoopsy- and this seemed like the perfect gift to get to go along with a doll. Each page features a different character as well as different items that relate to her. You get to add the different items to the page and learn about each doll. The book is not hardcover, and is about 12 pages long with 4 pages of stickers. The stickers include an array of things including fashion accessories, baking supplies, and even answers to math problems.It is an adorable book full of colorful pages, but doesn't really seem to keep my daughter entertained. She'll sit down and do activities for about 10 minutes and then finish for the day. She loves arts and crafts, but I think that because you can't really personalize the pages this book doesn't hold her interest. Not sure if I'd purchase it again. But it did make a nice addition to her collection of LaLaLoopsy items."
I got these a just a couple days after they were ordered. They were packaged well and they are really cute. All and all very happy
My daughter loved these!
Very very very cute cupcake toppers and cupcake wrappers we loved how they made her 2 nod birthday cupcakes look awesome
I ordered these for my daughters birthday and received the wrong product and could not get it in time for her party.
made a nice xmas gift
"I bought this one with another set. It's a very good purchase, good quality."
Great bundle deal! Too cute!
Quality dolls - My niece loves it.
Great product.
got these for a great price. cute. nice accessories.
came on time and just as described.
very good thks
"She is 3 and loves all Lalaloopsy toys! So do I! Silly, cutsie, and fun.... just like Molly! Love her!"
Exactly what I needed for my daughters birthday cake. She over them and they made the cake!! She plays with them now too.
"Very cute! My niece is very happy with her new lalaloopsy dolls, she loves it and plays with them frequently.!"
Yes I'm 20 years old and I bought these for myself. Lala loopsy are fun to collect (though expensive). Nothing to complain :)
Another gift for my Great grandkids.  they love all the Lalaloopsy dolls. Ideal for little girls  Waiting for the new ones to come out!
"Extremely cute little dolls. They have jointed,moveable arms and legs. Their little pets are very distinct, well made companions for the dolls. Everything about these sets is fun for little girls. My granddaughter loves them and plays with them often."
"I bought this with the Mini Lalaloopsy Carry Along Playhouse with Exlusive doll and Mini Lalaloopsy Fun House Peanut and Ember, Pack of 2.  She loves them and plays with them frequently."
My daughter loves lalaloopsy she has the big ones n the small ones even the ones that have spinning hair
"love all the dolls , but very hard to find them all, theymake so many to keep up with them"
This LaLaLoopsy is very very pretty. A sweet gift for any young lady. Any little girl age 3 to 10 will love her.
This doll is more adorable in person!!! My daughter loves this doll and it is the perfect edition to her Lalaloopsy Collection :-) Don't miss out on getting this doll!!!
"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter for this upcoming christmas. I always buy really early, so it will be a while before she plays with it, and I will update then.I bought this one because she's been wanting this ""angel"" lalaloopsy for a few months now, and I never could catch it on sale in the stores. I found it on Amazon while it was only 22.00 and snatched it. It is probably the most adorable lalaloopsy that she will own thus far. The eyes are blue, and she has wings and a halo. The little puppy is a poodle made of clouds :) Perfect for the ""christmas"" theme.Looks sturdy, none of the paint was chipped and the packaging was perfect."
"I bought this for my granddaughter.  I collect angels, so this was her first angel for her very own collection!!!!!!!  A little pricey, but it was worth it to see the smile on my Gianna's face."
"I received this as a Birthday gift and, I love it! She is just too adorable! I collect Lalaloopsies and, I've search high and low for this particular one. It's really hard to find. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised, when I received this one from a relative. Definately, all smiles here. :-)"
"She is a hard-to-find doll that is not seen that often in the stores. So, I am glad that I have found her on here. She was a few more dollars that what is actually sold in the stores and on the makers website, but that was okay! Love her!"
daughter found a small Lalaloopsy doll during the Australia trip.This doll is just right size that she can hug. My daughter is a captive of this doll completely.
This doll is one of the best one made. my doughter loves her blue magical eyes and her pretty pink dress.
"Very durable, not very educational but super cute clothing and great for imaginative little girls! Super cute angelic tutu outfit and innocent blue eyes make this lalaloopsy so sweet!Comes with poster and poodle dog"
"my grandniece ws beside herself, and all of her 6 years of mind and body just were in unison in cheering the arrival of the toy. she has a huge collection, i heard (16 dolls and counting), and this addition was not old news but ever new."
"I just picked this doll up after searching every store for her. She is absolutely gorgeous and I'm so excited to add her to my daughters' collection. With 2 girls this has become an expensive, yet fun little hobby of collecting the large and small ones. I found this doll at a local Walmart, but if you can't find it there then buy it here!"
cute
"These crazy Lil toys have taken over little girls everywhere! My nieces adore them, so if it makes them happy, I'll gladly oblige. But seriously, Toy Industry, please stop playing all us adults for fools and make a toy actually WORTH the price we have to pay to bring smiles to these little faces! The nieces are happy, but I feel a little like a used up old snot rag for having purchased these! This one gets 3*s due to the fact it didn't even come with the tiny shopping bag these usually come with, making me feel all that much more pitiful for having spent a pretty penny on something the size of pocket change!"
Good
"It's not rare at all, I wanted to surprise my daughter but she had 2 if these already."
This shopkins cupcake is so cute.
This is the only thing my daughter wanted for Christmas. It arrived on time and in thw original package. She plays with them every day. These are the smallest LaLaloopsy dolls you can purchase.
My daughter enjoys playing with the tinies
A+++++++
"Best of the 3 games I bought for Christmas, but still needed some help.  I would rather have had the trigger words provided.  Seemed that everyone got hooked on songs from particular movies/plays.  Not everyone in the group was participating correctly, so that was an issue.  The cards you draw often hurt more than helped.  And how the winner is chosen is ridiculous.  We ended up just saying whoever made it to the finish line first wins.  But the concept is good.  With the right people, this game could be fun."
"Might be the most fun we've ever had playing a board game!  We laughed ourselves silly.  The game is quick to learn, and length of games depends on how many players you have.  We played several games.  With three people each took about 30 minutes.  My son burst into show tunes we had no idea he knew and we discovered my daughter could rap.  This was a huge hit and will be the first game we pull out next time.  Don't think twice.  Get it and play."
just ordered the game cuz it sounded fun.  delivered in timely fashion and in good shape.  My kids know lots of songs and love to sing so think it will be a great game for family night and reunions.
The kids really liked it! They stayed entertained for quite some time! They are high school theater kids who love to sing!
Great game to play at family gatherings with a wide range of ages and musical tastes.  Also a fun party game when friend come over.  Would make a great hostess/host gift.
"This game was fun for me, I am a music buff and lover. My adult children didn't love it though- thought it was hard and not as fun as others we play."
Hedbanz is an awesome game! This game is a great addition for game night...both family and friends really enjoyed it!!!
"I got this game for my family, preteen and teenagers. It is so much fun! We laugh all the time!"
I got this as an extra gift for my grandkids.  They have a lot of fun playing it and it's fun to watch them.
"Didn't catch on with us.  It was rather difficult, and it just wasn't that fun or funny.Considered returning it, but then just ended up using the cards (various nouns & pronouns) for charades, which we had a blast playing.  So, I guess not a wasted purchase."
"Ok, so sometimes I get a bit frustrated but we ALWAYS end up laughing hysterically with this game. My whole family plays from my 9 yr old, 18 yr old, myself, my husband and my son's girlfriend. If the cats could play they would. There is nothing inappropriate about it so the ""Adult"" version is harmless."
"A ton of fun, it is like twenty question on steroids! Couldn't stop laughing... family fun night!  And the kids version is just as fun to with the young ones that can't read."
"We loved playing this game during the holidays, and will certainly bring it out again every time the family gathers!"
"I had never heard of this game until I purchased another product, but was very impressed by the description. My family has had a blast playing it this week! Thanks!"
I got this as a Christmas present for my teenage daughters. We played it on Christmas Day and it was hit. Family ranged in age 16 to 46 and everyone loved it!
this game was a lot of fun for my family. We are big song buffs and it was really fun trying to come up with songs to stump each other.
What a great idea for a game!  My friends and I were laughing hysterically and having a great time. It's infinitely re-playable and there are no moving parts to break.  Just great fun all around.  I like the fact that the players themselves come up with the challenges.  Fantastic game.
"Oh my goodness! This games is so much fun. It never gets old. You have to know music, a good song list. If you love music then you will love this game!"
This is a cool new spin on the party conversations that revolve around our music memories. It is a great way to get a party interesting!
"I originally wanted to get my niece the lalaloopsy doll with all the hair so she could entertain herself with it, but i noticed these dolls are very heavy in the head and would be awkward trying to seat them only to fall over. So I found these soft dolls online and my niece absolutely loves them. I got her the whole collection!"
"I bought this for my granddaughter.  She and her sister both love these dolls.  This is my first ""soft"" one.  It is very cute and I am sure they will love it. The soft ones are quite a bit smaller than the smaller than the plastic dolls, but are still cute and will be nice for snuggling times."
"As a parent, I had alwasy wondered why the original Lalaloopsy dolls were made out of hard plastic.  I think this is MGA's response.  The soft dolls are very cute and of course, much more cuddly than the original. Unfortunately, they are also about half the size which begs the question ""Why don't they made full-sized soft dolls?"".  Having said that, I would recommend them for your Lalaloopsy fan at the MSRP of $14.99.  My daughter has the original Peanut Big Top so she wanted to get the Soft Doll version as her ""little sister"".  It is very cute ! Finally, some of them are more popular than others (e.g. Crumbs Sugar Cookie) and I have seen sellers price them for double.  Do NOT pay those prices ! They are not worth it, again, as they are way smaller than the original dolls.  Just be patient and wait for Amazon.com to get them back in-stock."
EXCELENT
wayover priced for what it was but child was thrilled
Disappointed!!! Never in a million years will I pay an exorbitant amount of money on a PLASTIC COUCH OR BED!!!!!!!!truly disgusting that people take full advantage of a kids Christmas wish list!!!!The house is great but----------I contacted the manufacturer and complained--NO HELP:(
"I bought the doll house, never imagining that the couch and the bed would each cost more than the whole house.  Why would anyone pay $144.00 for a doll house bed ?  I thought for sure that these must be sized for the children and not the dolls.  I'm blown away that this is doll house furniture.  I can't and will not pay $300.00 for Lalaloopsy to have a bed and couch in her doll house.  I'll buy myself a new chair first.  Seriously, I'm not cheap but I think everyone has gone crazy on this one !"
"Luv the heavy duty plastic. This will definitely last through the toughest crowd.  The dolls sit nicely.  Great experience with amazon. Looked on other sites, but so glad I went with amazon. Thanks for making my party a hit!"
"This product is great.  It stands up to the abuse of daily daycare use.  It gets thrown, tossed and sat on, but still looks brand new."
"Speedy service, good quality, great that I could get it on line well before it was available in the shops in Australia."
Santa brought the doll house so grandma and grandpa bought the furniture. She loved it. Couldn't decide on the pink or the orange couch.  I am glad we got the pink one.
"First off--any toy that cannot break, I love!!My daughters got the LaLaLoopsy wooden dollhouse for Christmas and we were on a quest to furnish it! I bought both couches, the pink and orange, they are durable, hold two dolls, and can be wiped clean. I highly reccomend this item to LaLaLoopsy lovers!!"
It does what it is designed to do. Plastic dolls say it really comfortable. They only wish it was a sleeper sofa.
"It just literally sits there. It's a couch, no more, no less.  Most dolls and pets don't stay upright as well. Otherwise, cute..that's about it."
Great addition to doll house it'll make it all come together! A lot bigger than I thought too the dolls will fit nicely!!
"If you have a Lalaloopsy Fan, even without a house to put this couch into, this is a good accessory to have. The dolls by nature do not sit well but the couch fits that well and is very durable. Bright colors and soft heavy flexible plastic/rubber like feel."
Great quality.  THe dolls fit perfectly large or small.  The color is bright and beautiful. Matches with the house and its very large.
This little couch is so cute and adds a nice touch to the Lala loppsey Littles setshe's going to love it!
My daugher absolutely loves Lalaloopsy Minis.  They are extremely cute and I have to admit that I love them too.  Not crazy about the full size dolls but for the price I could buy the minis for her all day long.  She loves to collect them.
I bought the dolls for one of my granddaughters and she was very happy. It was just the one she wanted!
These were very cute.  They were smaller than expected.  I also wanted to separate them to give to twin granddaughters but could not without really making a mess of the packaging.
This was a great purchase.  It had two Lalaloopsies in one package and my daughter absolutely loved it.  She was so excited when she opened it.
"I bought it for my nice, I thought the price was good and it was so convenient not to have to go to the mall or Walmart to shop during the holidays .. My niece loves this dolls..."
"Got them for Christmas and my 4 year old daughter absolutely loved them! Thay are gorgeous, unique, different and fun!"
"I thought the figures would be a little larger than they actully were.  Since I was giving it as a gift, I didn't open it to see the quality, but it didn't look like it had much good quality."
I bought these for a present and they are really cute.  This set was requested and I know my friend's daughter who is turning 5 will love them!
Aw
"Dot Starlight has the wrong coloring, other than that...The tinies are good."
"My daughter loves Lalaloopsy and this was a great addition. It was also cheaper here than at the store, which made it worth it."
My daughter loves them. She is 7 and something about little things calls to them right now.
Daughter loves them
My 3 year old girl loves anything Lalaloopsy so when i say these i knew is was a must have for Christmas. We have lots of the full and mini sized dolls But with my daughter she loves having small little toys that she can just walk around the house and play with and so when she opened these they were one of her favorite gifts these are the best lalaloopsy dolls to come out yes they are so tinny and cute you cant help but to love them I will be getting her 2 packets and making homemade surprise eggs to open for Easter...
Cute as a button!
I have received this product from MGAE as part of their toy tester program. This lalaloopsy Tinies are absolutely amazing! My little girl loves to collect them and we have all the houses now and all those tinies dolls! Thank you MGAE for creating this cute collectibles dolls! Bring more- we love them!!
Excellent
Love the new tinies! They are just as cute as the big dolls but love the smaller size. Each set has a different surprise character and no two characters are alike so that is a bonus...not worrying you will end up with a bunch of the same. The heads do pull off but they do not easily fall off and are not hard to attach back on. I really like the variety in the packs as far as what tinies come in what packs. The only thing wrong with the pack I received is Dot's skin color. We also have another set and I noticed the skin tone is wrong on one of the dolls. To my daughter it is no big deal she loves them anyways but hopefully will be looked at by the company. I did receive this toy from MGAE as part of the toy tester but my opinion is my own.
My daughters love anything and everything Lalaloopsy. They are easy to pack around to play with anywhere. With holes down the middle of them they even go in the bath with them. The only negative thing I can find to say about these is Dot's skin color is off and my girls didn't know who she was. She is my 7 year olds favorite. I have received this product from MGAE as part of their toy tester program.
"I have received this product from MGAE as part of their toy tester program.The Tinies line is, in my opinion, one of the most exciting things to come from the Lalaloopsy line this year! They're adorable, affordable (less than $1 per Tiny when buying the larger multi-packs at retail cost!), and highly addictive! My favorites from this particular pack are Jelly and Toasty - I love the food-themed Lalas, and I love Jelly's transparent dress! This set also includes a variant of Jewel and her pet kitty, making it a great option for those who would rather have more figures than the house playset that includes the regular Jewel Tiny.Other Pros:The character variety! There is a HUGE selection of characters in this line, and there are STILL some characters that haven't been made into Tinies yet! I especially like that the holiday characters are being included, and I hope that more BOYS make the cut in future waves! The pets aren't quite as appealing to me, especially since they're the same size as the pets that come with the Mini dolls, but they are pretty cute, too.The packaging. I'm glad that there is only 1 mystery character per pack, and that there aren't any repeats in any of the sets. It makes collecting them all a lot less frustrating than the Micros were.Each set includes a checklist so you can easily keep track of which Tinies are in your collection.I was afraid these were going to be very much like Squinkies, but they are much better; they are slightly larger, and they aren't made of that squishy/rubbery material, which I think will make them easier to keep clean. (Though I would like to mention that their heads, like the Squinkies/unlike the Micros, are not meant to turn. Other than that, they seem very durable.)Cons:My ONLY complaint with this pack in particular is that Dot Starlight's skin appears to have been lightened, which doesn't sit right with me. I know the fans didn't appreciate her much when she was first released as a large doll, but she has gained a LOT of fans since then, and I wish she was given as much attention and love from MGAE as the other ""Original 8"" characters.I have purchased several other items from this line myself, and I would definitely recommend them to friends. I think kids will love them (especially kids that love miniature things!), and I hope the line continues in the future!"
Granddaughter loved them with all the varieties. Cute little girls.
"""Sew"" adorable! Can't wait for Christmas! Perfect stocking stuffer!"
Excellent
cute!!
My granddaughter love this one.
Daughter loves it!
Cute addition to a friend's Lalaloopsy collection. She liked it a lot.
My daughter and I love collecting these mini Lalaloopsy dolls. This is one of our favorites
"I have two pre-teen girls in the neighborhood who go crazy over the Mini Lalaloopsy - Great hand toy for little fingers and growing minds. I always give these out as Christmas gifts to the neighborhood children, who are less fortunate. I often ask the children there Christmas wish in October and it always surprises me that this is the number one toy they request... Found these during one of Amazons special deal of the day it was a great price could not pass them up..."
My grand daughter loves it !!
hate it
Tiny but beautiful! I thought was going to be a little bit bigger!  My daughter loves them!  I wish they will say the measurements.
"My daughter has wanted this lalaloopsy for awhile, I had searched the stores and couldn't find it so glad I found it here!"
"My 4 year old daughter already has the bigger doll, so this is a perfect size for traveling or keeping it inside tha car so she gets entertained."
My Ellia loves LaLaLoopsy so much that it was the theme of her birthday. She adores this toy and it is very well made.
"This doll like the other mini lalaloopsy is very beautiful, weel made and the price is correct compare with retail store here in Puerto Rico. My daugther love it and play with it every day."
my daughter loves her lala's! she plays with them all the time and is so happy she got a bunch for Christmas!
"My grand daughter loves these. So I buy one every Christmas, Birthday for her. One day  she will have the entire collection"
"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she really likes it. The doll is sturdy, and put together well. She is another good fit for my daughters who love lalaloopsy's."
This is a great doll and my granddaughter is going to love it.  It has it own little house you buy it in and can be placed back into it when the child is through playing with it.  It is well worth the money.
Great!
My daughter loves this Lalaloopsy.
Love it! Girls was sooooooooo happy with her doll.
"My daughter loved this unexpected toy from Santa.  She had seen the Lala-Oopsie movie, so was excited when she saw this.  The zippered sleeping bag makes it that much more fun, since she loves taking it in and out of the bag."
"Purchased as a birthday gift for my niece. She was so thrilled when it arrived. She plays with it all the time.Great price, well worth it for the time my niece now plays with it."
"The holidays are my families annual Pictionary playoff. This year, I decided to bring this game and see how they liked it. Well, they LOVED it! They weren't even interested in playing Pictionary. We played over and over. The game doesn't have a long game cycle so the ""kids"" don't get bored. The great thing is that ALL ages can play and win. We had ages 12-68 represented. Grandpa won several games as did my 14-year old nephew.Looks like our family has a new tradition at the holidays!"
"Not only do I enjoy playing this with my family, even though my sisters and cousins completely dominated over me in this game, but my students thoroughly enjoyed it as well. As a teacher of grades K-8th, I decided to allow my middle school general music classes to play this game on a ""down"" day as I thought it would be a fun way to get them singing. The only problem I had was wanting to play along instead of monitoring the different groups!"
This game is a lot of fun. You have to be really creative. For some of my children it was a little too hard.
Our family played this game over the weekend.  There were 10 of us playing and we all enjoyed it - from teens to the older ones. I'd recommend it for any group who love music.
This game is everything it said would be.. Our family enjoyed it a lotWe have played it three times now.
found out most of the public doesnt know many songs so that they can sign it for others so I would suggest not buying it
Granddaughter was very happy!
Granddaughter love it!!!
The product is very good just wish it shipped faster
"so sorry, I haven't received them yet but I know my granddaughter will love them... She loved the season 1 mega pack."
"This game came in the exact packaging as if i were to get in the store, and still less expensive. We just played yesterday for over two hours and laughed so much. Honestly, if you're looking for a great game that doesn't have a ton of directions or trivia thinking...this is your game."
"We absolutely love this game! If you're looking for a game that's fun, not too easy but will definitely get some laughs from a great crowd, this is for you!"
I think this product definitely lived up to and exceeded its expectations and was exactly what I was looking to buy!
This is going to be a family gift that we will enjoy together. The game came in a box with other ordered items and it looks better than most board games that you try to buy at the store. I am very impressed with all my purchases through Amazon.
I gave this as a gift so I do not know if the game is actually fun or not.  This product arrived quickly.
"Good for any age, let the little ones pass on things they don't know.Good for any size group, 2 to 20, you don't NEED to use a headband to play.Good for any acquaintance, so funny with best friends, great fun for a first meet too!I've played this kind of game before, where you make up your own words then trade, this is just convenient for the premade cards and headbands.I think it is worth it to spend the money to be able to pull it out and play!"
"We have the kids version, and I saw this on Amazon for $6.99 so figured WHY NOT?!?!?  I can't wait to gather a group of adults and give it a try."
"It is a fun game, but get very boring after awhile because no one know how to question some of the cards."
We played this at our sisters game night and had so much fun. It is a lot of fun. Laughed a lot.
"My granddaughter is getting the Lalaloopsy doll house and the furniture for Christmas and I was amazed at the quality of the couch.  Very well made and bright, fun colors. Seems like it will last a long time. I would definitely recommend this item for any large doll house."
"Bought this for my girl as she loves everything Lalaloopsy and she uses it everyday to sit her lalaloopsy doll on. She even uses in her barbie dollhouse as an additional piece of furniture. The doll sits on it most of the time but like most Lalaloopsy dolls they don't sit up all that well on their own anyway, unles they are resting up against something! A must have for any Lalaloopsy fan!!"
My kid loves the couch especially in pink. Even without the need of buying everything Loopsy you can house them up better in a smaller scale house collection. It worked out well.
"She was delighted with the couch!  It was a Christmas gift, and I was very pleased to see the huge smile on her face and light in her eyes.  She was so excited!  It's nice when you get them something they really were looking forward to.  As for me.....I loved the quick and free shipping - that's the way I like to shop!"
"This couch is the perfect size for the dolls to sit on.  The big dolls have such heavy heads, they dont really sit well on anything.  This was the my daughters least favorite lalaloopsy toy she got."
"I bought this couch for my niece for christmas. Her lalaloopsy doll fits on it perfectly, and it also does fit two dolls. She loved it."
"This is a really cute and fun set of stencils and stickers.  When all the pictures were colored, I ordered another one!  The crayons are cute, but my daughter didn't really use those.  She preferred using markers she already owned."
Excelente!
Good service and I hope my granddaughter enjoys it.
Granddaughter loved it!
Got it for my 8 year old niece.  She loved the crayons and pages included in the book.  Very happy.
i love the coloring book and the colors they have. they are going in my granddaughters room and she loves them especially the ones like this one
"Item was taped up like it had been opened. All pieces still intact, but the description didn't say it was like that."
Very Nice ... High price though ... but bought it for a Holiday donation to a family for a child who was in love with Lalaloopsy ... that little girl deserved it ... and all the ladies in the office who were also contributing donations to the family thought it was great!
"You can hardly use the colors. You have to apply pressure when coloring and even after that, the colors are light and hard to see."
I cannot say enough good about these sets.  My 4 year-old daughter colored these and then cut them out like paper dolls. The act of cutting them out made her an expert with scissors and it didn't feel like work for her.  Please note these are not paper dolls and not really meant to be cut out but my daughter chose to do that. These books kept her occupied for a long while -- hours across days. She loves them -- she has two and I'm giving a third for Christmas.
"Lalaloopsy Minis are so very cute and addictive.  The fine little details delight small hands and eyes for hours.  I just wish they weren't so expensive.  The prices on these toys, which are very hard to find, are highway robbery.  It seems our local stores (three major retailers) carry four dolls at any given time...the same four on shelf for at least the last 10 months.  When they restock, they restock the same exact items.  So, if you child has decided to collect them, you turn to the internet to buy them, where on-line vendors gleefully charge you twice the cost, knowing you'll shell out the money to satisfy your princesses' Lalaloopsy cravings.  MGA is duplicitous in this scheme.  Boo."
"I knew this doll would be small, but this small? Am giving for Christmas gift to my young niece, (luckily not the only gift). I think she will like it."
"Just receive this set and my daughter (5) is in love with them. She loves Lalaloopsy and is happy that she can take the Tienies with her, where ever she goes. They have the perfect size. We had a hard time to recognize Dot cause her skin color is really off, what was disappointing to my Daughter cause she loves Dot the most.I have received this product from MGAE as part of their toy tester program"
"got these for my who adores lalaloopsy. (she is 7) they are very cute, and they aren't like squinkies, which made us very happy! i thought it would be a little too expensive if they were, but they are solid little toys and they are really cute. bigger than i thought they would be. definitely a hit. very cute."
My daughter love it
Niece loves her Lalaloopsy I got her! TY!
"This toy is exactly as you see it. Lalaloopsy doll, mini figure, accessories and the box it comes in is her stage."
Very nice. Very hard to find. Received quickly. Shipped well. Product as described and pictured. Daughter absolutely loved adding this one to her collection.
My granddaughter loves these little dolls. This is one she did not have. She was very excited. She loved it.
I bought this for my 6 year old daughter. She has several of the Lalaloopsy mini dolls and play sets. She can spend hours playing with them.
I bought these for my grandchild and she loves playing with them. She has her favorites and loves the little ballerina skirt that this Lalaloopsy wears. I have purchased more than one as when her friends come to play they need more Lalaloopsy's to have a party.The price is quite reasonable for a little doll that gives so much enjoyment.
My toddler loves this. It is smaller so it is easy for her to carry around. It is cute and my daughter likes to put the doll in her storage strawberry to sleep in bed with her. Worthwhile purchase.
"Super cute, my daughter loves lalaloopsy dolls and this is one of the two things she asked for from Santa. She loves it and was ever so excited when she opened it. Worth every penny."
My girls have been Lalaloopsy fans since the beginning.  This is the first Oopsie my older daughter asked for. She has quickly become a favorite :)
very fast shipping and exactly what i expected
My 4 year old grand daughter loves Lalaloopsy and she loves fairies. this was the perfect gift and my baby plays with her a lot.
I got this for my niece because she wanted it for Christmas. She loves Lalaloopsy and this doll is adorable!
My daughter has wanted this toy for over a month. We got it for her as a reward for schoolwork. I choose to buy it from Amazon because it was less than half the price of Target. The toy arrived in 2 days in pristine condition. My daughter loves it. The quality is nice and the outfit & cacoon fit her other dolls as well.
Bought this for my 4 year olds birthday. She loves it! She plays with it all the time. I would highly recommend it to anyone that loves Lalaloopys!!
"I ordered this for my neice who is just turning 3 years old, specifically because the description says it's for 3 and up. But the package arrived, and it says 4 and up. Now i have to hold on to this doll for a year because i dontvwant to pay for return shipping. Aside from that problem, the toy arrived quickly, not damaged, and is very cute."
"Bought as gift for daughter, she loved it, It is as expected. Wings fold in slightly for sleeping. Box is large but when doll is taken out she is quite compact."
"My 3  year old loves lalaloospy, so i got this for her birthday and it was  a hit . i had complications with the shipping but as soon as i called we got the matter taken care of fast and customer service is polite."
Was so Cute and was a Better  Priced then Stores and also it was easier to get here then in the store. Stores were always Out.
"My daughter really wanted this after watching the Lala Oopsie show on tv. She has never played with it though. It is hard, and boring, and not even very cute. You can't snuggle it, and it's really hard to get it into it's little sleeping bag. Bummer."

Fairy Daffodil looks just like she looks in the pictures. She fits snugly in her pouch and it can be easily hung just about anywhere. The zipper is kid-friendly. I wasn't worried about little fingers getting hurt.
So cute. For my 6yr old Grand-daughters birthday. She loves anything Lalaloopsy or petshop.  This will surely  be a hit!!!
Purchased this for the youngest Granddaughter for Christmas.  She loves the Lalaoopsy dolls and this one is no exception.  She plays with it all the time so I believe it was a hit!
My 6 year old loved it
My daughter was not too happy with her.
My grand-daughter is going to love this doll.
Very beauty doll!!!  My little daughter just love it.
Beautiful
Granddaughter loves it. It is so adorable.
The shape and stitching are bad quality. Some seams don't line up graphically. The pet is just a stuffed lump.On a positive note: my daughter loves her. :/
"my granddaughter went nuts for this dolly. She was well made which i was thankful for, considering the cost of these dolls. She was just as pictured and is really cute"
This was one of my Granddaughters Christmas gifts. I didn't know if she would like the soft lalaloopsy  ( she has a big collection) but she said she loves the soft one. So two thumbs up!
My Granddaughter loves the Lalaloopsy dolls. I'm winding up getting her quite the collection! She even sleeps with them all!
"This doll is a really sweet addition to the Lalaloopsy collection. I have to say that I absolutely love Lalaloopsy & I am so glad my daughter does too because then I have an excuse to buy them. ;)My daughter is 6 years old & she loves to swaddle all of her dolls & put them all to sleep bundled in blankets. So when I saw that this little fairy (who happened to be her favorite character from the Lala Oopsie Movie) came with her own little pod, I had to get it for her. And my instincts were right, she absolutely loves this doll. :)An added bonus to toys like this one is that they don't do anything special (like make noise, move or dance on their own). They just wait for you to play with them using your imagination.I think the price is more than reasonable considering the price of most other Lalaloopsy items. The quality is very high. Even those these dolls are made to look floppy & rag-like, they are very durable & sturdy. Of the few we have I have yet to see one break, chip or show any kind of wear. You do get what you pay for.Note: In the description notes it says this doll comes with a pet. I purchased mine in store & it did not come with a pet, nor did it mention a pet on the box. She comes with a little cardboard milk carton, but that is all."
These are all very expensive so this was a good price for these new additions to the Lalaloopsy family.  They are super cute and my daughter loves them.
"All of these Lalaoopsy Fairy Dolls are wonderful! This is our 4th and final one in the collection and my 5 yr. old daughter is thrilled to have them.  We started with just one, Fairy Fern, then my daughter decided Fairy Fern needed a friend, so that's was how we started. The price is reasonable and it's about where I would cap the price for a birthday present should I want to buy another one in the future for one of my daughter's playmates."
"I got these as ice breakers to a party I was hosting.  We changed up the rules a bit...as everyone came in, they grabbed a headband and a card was placed in it.  They then had to go around the room questioning people for clues as to what it was, first one to guess one a prize. (we put them on backwards so no one could catch their reflection in a window, glass or mirror and cheat)  This brought a lot of laughs, bad clues, and even worse guessing, but it got everyone acquainted/comfortable with each other.  It is also a fun game if playing it by the regular rules, although a few drinks makes it even funnier."
Product was delivered as promised.  Excellent price compared to other retail stores.  Bought as Christmas present for my older son!  We love music and this game is right up our alley!
I haven't play this game yet but I bought it because every who has play it love it. that is why I bought it
This was to be a family gift for us. My youngest didn't want to team up with his brother to play against my husband and I because we've always had a song for any word thrown at us. But once we started the game my youngest owned it. He loves it now.
"We got this game for Christmas and played it the same day. It turned out to be really fun for our whole family. We have kids ages 10,8,and 6 and they all had fun playing together with us. Even our 3 year old chimed in with some of his own songs.  Since then, my 10 yr. old has been playing it with all her friends. We are excited to try it out with our adult friends for a couples game night."
I was first introduced to this game at a party.  It was easy to learn and we all had an absolute blast playing.  I was so impressed I bought my own and brought it home to play with the family.  I have never seen a game that plays equally as well in a family setting or a party setting.  This game is a must play.
"Super fun game! Adults can play it with adults, kids can play it with kids, or adults can play it with kids. We love it!"
I have played this game a bunch if times and it has always been a blast.  My favorite is when someone forgets what song they had chosen for a word and then have to scramble to think of it.  Great game for kids too!
An absolute blast!  You'll end up laughing so much at what everyone comes up with and what people sing...especially if players can't carry a tune!!
I have played this game with friends and family of all ages.  No matter how young or old everyone always manages to get stumped at some point! Half the fun is hearing people sing out of key and learning what random music people listen to.  I brought it in to work and had a lunch game.  It was such a hit! I even find myself breaking into a song from words people say in conversations. Its SO addicting!
"I can't sing......but, I CAN'T STOP SINGING!!  The premise of the game Spontuneous has lived in my head for years and now I can finally use my hidden talent to win at a board game! Since I can remember, I have always thought of music and burst into song when people say certain words that have triggered me to think of my favorite songs.  Example: Friend- ""Hey, where did you get those boots?"" Me- ""THESE BOOTS ARE MADE FOR WALKIN, AND THAT""S JUST WHAT THEY""LL DO, ONE OF THESE DAYS THESE BOOTS ARE GONNA WALK ALL OVER YOU.""  Sometimes I get weird looks, but mostly people just join in, so join in on the fun!  I highly recommend Spontuneous if you want non-stop fun and laughter over the holidays."
I can't rate this.  I gave it as a gift and have no idea of what it's like.  The boy I gave it to said it was fun.
Great game to play with a group.plain silly fun.  Try to guess what you are by asking the other people playing questions. Be prepared to laugh hysterically
I ordered this for our vacation home.  Everyone loves it.  We had played it with our granddaughter and her husband and it was so much fun to laugh with them.
I took this on a ladies weekend. It was a blast. So fun!  We wanted to play again and again!
This is a fun game for all ages!  A great family game that is easy to play without a lot of complicated directions or rules. Not much set up either. One of our favorites!
Such a fun game to play with adults! I wish it came with more headbands because we usually play with a group of 8+ but other than that it is really a great way to just enjoy the night with young or old adults.
"My 4.5-year-old daughter is now obsessed with these small art kits (re: please see my review on the ""Monster High"" version).Kit includes:-72 stickers. Various accessories- mostly hair adornments; props consist of lollipops, telescopes, popcorn. The girls' pets are included for placement on the inside back cover. Buy extra stickers beforehand for more of a selection.-25 perforated sketch sheets. Faces and any uncovered body part of 'loopsies is already printed in color...all kid has to do is create an outfit with the included stencils or just color in the existing basic outfit. Hair and pet is up to the kid, too. Xerox unused sheets if possible for the future.-Two stencil sheets of clothing, hair stuff, and small shapes.-Ten markers which are non-washable. Standard rainbow colors, black, brown, pink, and dark green for pine tree lovers.Everything is held within the kit for on-the-go action. 5"" max W x 7.5"" max L. All components can survive general kid life. My daughter can spend a good hour with this kit. Does not stunt her creativity in the least. For three and up."
"My daughter loves Lalaloopsies and loves to draw.  She had her eye on this set for quite some time and finally acquired it yesterday after earning money from chores.  Was it worth it?It is a complete set.  The way it all folds up is nice, and the cardboard covering is made of sturdy stuff, so you don't have to worry about it falling apart.  Inside there are multiple pages of the same Lalaloopsy doll outlines for you to make outfits on.  It comes with markers (that close up nicely and neatly inside the little compact package) and two stencil pages.  You lay these over the dolls and can use the stencils to make different clothes and a variety of accessories.  Pajamas, dresses, headbands, arm warmer, stars, hearts, bows... it's all covered.Quite a few markers are included... more than the usual sparse 4 that come with these type of sets.  Unfortunately they are EXTREMELY cheap and were dried out when we got the set!  This should not have happened... markers are not that expensive to manufacture.  If we had bought this out somewhere or to save as a travel time surprise, there would have been a lot of disappointment, as there wasn't enough ink left in them to do more than two (very faded looking) pages.  However, she has plenty of markers of her own, so this was not an issue.  Just beware that there is a chance that the markers will be dried when you get the set.Other than that, it's a great creative tool... who knows, future clothing designers may get their start with this cute little set!"
Adorable set!
Great product! Looking forward to my daughter playing with this on Christmas morning.  Love that the inserts come out easily.
It's exactly what my grandaughter wanted for a Christmas gift this year.  She's going to be a happy and smiling kid.
I must have misunderstood the description of the doll. I thought it would actually look like the doll pictured with the little fuzzy skirt and boots. But it is all just plastic. It is still very cute but only gave 4 stars because of that.
"The overall idea is great,the stickers are beautiful, but crayons color so light that no one of the creations turned out good. The figures created with the stencils are too small to be colored with crayons included. Tried with markers but they pass on to next page, ruining two pages ate the same time,  so there is no good idea either."
Everything was excellent
"Bought this item because my daughter and I really enjoy them. However I would have expected the pages to be reusable, as in wipe-off , and the stencils are very flimsy and move way too much to make a pretty dress on the dolls. My daughter was very dissatisfied with this item and lost interest very quickly."
Cute
My 5yr. old daughter love it! The crayons are super cute and add on stickers to complete the coloring page! She was extremely happy and want to share her pages with her friends.
"Very cute doll! The paint job on the one I received wasn't as good as other Loopsy dolls. The colors were faded like it was out in the sun too long. The person I bought it for still likes it, but the coloring just felt off."
"Bought this for my granddaughter she loves these dolls, very happy with the product granddaughter was happy as well she used as soon as she opened."
"I was SO happy they created a mini version of this doll cause I think she actually looks better than the large version as I didn't think the plastic hood looked great with the bottom outfit.  Since she is a mini, all of it is plastic and I think it looks more cohesive.  There are so many cute Lalas but she is definitely one of the most adorable."
"This is not something I find to be cute.....However my girl likes it and plates with it regularly! However, she said it floats, so she took it in the lake and now has water inside of the head.....cannot get it out...,FYI"
Birthday present for my great niece.  She loves it!  I will purchase more of this type of gift for Christmas and birthdays.
She was so exited when she got her Lala Oopsie fairy. I am much happier that the head is not so hard like the original Lala Loopsie dolls. Her original I thought was going to be soft like a rag doll with yarn hair but was a hard plastic not great for sleeping with. These new Lala oopsies are soft foam heads much nicer I think. She received lilac fairy and one of the princes Ansie dolls for her birthday. I wanted to point out the princess oopsies are similar in size to the origanal dolls while the faries are smaller. Not as small as the mini sets but just the right size for taking out and about or for sleep overs since it leaves room in her bag for her clothes and essentials. My little girl really likes to take her fairy on sleep overs since she has her own sleeping bag (the cocoon it comes with.)
My 7year old granddaughter loves these dolls she has almost the whole collection waiting for new ones to come out.
"My 6 year old has been Lalaloopsy crazy for a couple of years now, and collects all of them.  Once the ""Oopsie's"" were released, she absolutely had to have them!  We got her this for her birthday, and she immediately fell in love.  I'm glad to see this line thriving and expanding, and I know she's looking forward to plenty of future friends to play with!"
My daughter loves this toy looks great and got it quickly thanks. My daughter would love to get another one she thinks it needs a friend.
one of the best
Granddaughtr was happy with this find.
"The toy was fine, but the photo showed it with the shopping bag. The bag did not come with the toy, nor did it have any packaging."
Good
yay
"This particular item has mouth but, no eyes.We were dissapointed."
cute. kids like it.
Makes a cute stocking stuffer
my daughter loves the Lala mini's and this one is one of her favorites! she loves that they come with some sort of little accessories with every mini.
Great product at a great price.
Great!
Purchased for my 3 yr old Granddaughter. . She loves pink!  So this little Lalaloopsy was a hit with her.
"We love the Loopsy line of toys, the minis are no different. This was perfect to go with an outfit for a gift. Small enough to give something else with the outfit we had picked out but a big enough deal to collect."
My 4 year old Daughter absolutely loves her Mini Lalaloopsy. It is a great travel size toy that she can take with her everywhere. She thinks it is super cute because of her love of cats and I love it because of its affordability.
Will be a great gift! So cute! Received quickly and in good condition. My daughter will enjoy this when she's a little older as she is only 2 and there are small pieces.
My granddaughter loves it very very much and thank you so much Santa Claus.  See you next December.  (She told me what to post.)
these were much smaller than they appear online.  When they got to the house I was almost embarrassed to give them as a gift because of the size.
"Saw another kid with it, it is a wonderful toy for kids to take alongside the characters are very sweet"
"My granddaughter loves this doll,I was so happy to hear her open it she was so excited when she opened it,great buy"
My 3 year old granddaughter is crazy over this show.  I try to purchase pillow type dolls for her because she likes sleeping with them.  This doll was a nice size and very reasonably priced.  She was overjoyed over her Lalaloopsy.  I was extremely satisfied with this product.
"The doll is adorable and did the thing for my daughter's new obsession with the Lalaloopsy show.  These soft dolls are about 10 inches high and perhaps about 4 inches wide. They are not substantial squishy things to hug while sleeping (although my daughter tries her best to do so).  they're cute, not educational, and not functional in any way but to look at or drag around.  I suppose that's why I am amazed at the price of these dolls.  I realize we are paying mostly for the name brand, but I've seen these dolls range in price online from $25-$65!!  WHAAAAAT??Here's my rating breakdown:Doll itself: TWO STARSSELLER: HALF a STAR for selling this product for $25 and when it arrived, the back of the box had a TJ Maxx sticker on it for $14.99!!  EPIC FAIL for the seller: The Wandering Giant on their overt attempt to turn a profit.  FYI...remove the label if you're gonna mark up the product!Amazon: FIVE STARS for taking my call at customer service and immediately crediting me the difference."
"I ordered this item for a birthday gift. The doll is soft bodied, and was still in original package when shipped but was shipped in a plastic envelope (like clothing is sometimes shipped in) and therefore the packaging for the doll was horribly damaged and therefore I couldn't wrap the doll and give it at the party as it no longer looked presentable/new in the condition it arrived in. I gave it to my niece afterwards and she loved it, so overall a good item, but needs better shipping methods."
My 4 ur old granddaughter loves this doll. I was happy when they started making them soft. The plastic one would have been broken in one day.I'm sure I'll be buying more for her
I got this doll for my daughter for her birthday and she just loves it. It is very well made and adorable!
"She isnt as cute in person, her head is kind of warped shaped. but my 3 year old doesnt notice or care, she loves it! =)"
"I BOUGHT SEVERAL OF THESE SETS FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER, NOT KNOWING WHICH ONE SHE WOULD LIKE AND THEY WERE VERY INEXPENSIVE. SHE LOVED EVERY ONE OF THEM."
"It's cute, but the face come a little deformed. Not as big as it looks. Kind of disappointing... but cute..."
"My 3 year old loves this doll. It is small but it was the perfect size for her. The doll is soft and just as cute as the picture. It doesn't come with any small parts which makes it perfect for smaller children, less to lose."
"This is a sweet little doll that is just large enough to be huggable, yet small enough to travel easily.  My DD loves it."
"I got this for my two year old, who loves her older sister's Lalaloopsy dolls and wanted to be able to sleep with one.  The regular dolls are so heavy and hard that they don't make great sleeping companions, but this one is perfect."
She plays for hours with her soft dolls. I like the ease of cleaning them and also know there are safe for her as well. She loves these brands so we will continue to collect them.
I bought this to fill a Christmas list by one of my great-granddaughters. She is really cute. I purchased 4 of the Lalaloopsy soft dolls as gifts to others little girls that I needed to buy for. They all are so cute.
Will be returning it because it was not at all like expected.  We saw it cheaper at other stores as well.
love them!!
Perfect!
Excellent !!
Initially purchased this because I thought it would be a bit more 18+ style adult. However this is not one of those games. While still fun the topics are merely geared towards a more learned audience.
"Was bought this game as a gift and was really looking forward to using it with the family, including a deaf relative.  However the cards and several of the head bands were missing from the game.  I contacted Spinmasters and asked if they could either (a). replace the missing pieces, (b). send a new game and I would gladly mail the defective game back to them.  They have done NOTHING.  They have lost my business and I urge others not to buy their stupid games because if something goes wrong then too bad for the consumer. Their customer care SUCKS!"
"What can I say, this game is the bomb.  It's funny from start to finish.  It's good for about any event in which board games are being played."
"Yea we played it, you def have to make up your own rules. Figure your rules out first before you play to make it fun from the beginning."
"I just played this game for the first time and had an absolute blast.  Great game, lots of laughter and looking forward to playing again!"
"I was looking for a game to play with my family that wouldn't cause my kids to roll their eyes when we sat them down for some ""family fun.""  Spontuneous is that game!  Our whole family can't wait to play again."
This game is fun and easy to play in small or large groups. Good quality as well. We have enjoyed it.
"we had adult game night at the house with friends and this game was pretty cool and had people really stumped on what they were by asking questions to figure out if they were a person, place, or thing."
Love the game!!!!!!!  We saw a version of the game on I Carley........and we just had to have it.  Gives us hours of family time with many laughs
"Great family game that is a lot fun. For those that know the card game ""Indian"", this is an enhanced version that is a lot more fun (people, places, and things versus a playing card)."
"This game was a breeze to get started; put a card on your head, set the timer, start asking yes or no questions. That's was when the real fun began. Trying to narrow down what you have on your card from ""everything"" to what it actually was is very challenging. It is a lot of fun to guess, but just as much fun to watch others fumble their way to the answer. We laughed a lot!!!"
"This game is fantastic. We have played it with all different groups of family and friends and it is always a hit. If you run out if headbands, just pin the card to your hair!"
An absolute riot.  Forget the rules.  Forget the timer.  Drag this one out after a few rounds of drinks and let the fun begin.
Played this game for the first time at a friends house for game night.  A group of 12 adults.  Lots of fun.  Planning on playing with our daughter who is 10.
"For anyone who has any self-confidence whatsoever, please be advised that this game will eradicate almost every trace of it.While on the cover, it may seem like a harmless, friendly game to be enjoyed amongst friends, it is actually a device for generating hatred.Each word that is chosen for your head is so mind-numbingly ambiguous that you will find yourself endlessly asking question upon question to help clarify exactly what the topic plastered on your forehead is.Of course, with each guess you find your belief in yourself as a competent human being quickly evaporating, replaced with a void of self-belief, and a tendency to question whether or not you are in fact a Neanderthal.The fact is that there is no conventional line of questioning that can correctly establish the answer, but more importantly, your friends are too incompetent and/or cruel to ask you those questions anyway.Typical scenarios of a question and associated answers can be as follows:Guesser: Okay, it's a place. Is it indoors?Friend 1: YES!Friend 2: NO!Friend 3: COULD BE? MAYBE?Friend 4: TECHNICALLY IT'S IN A BLACK HOLEThe answer for the above round was 'Garage'.All in all, this is the worst way to spend your time on this planet, and is likely even more torturous than eating a bowl of cereal filled with razor blades.Avoid at all costs, for the love of all that is holy."
"This is a fun and easy game to learn.We played it around a campfire and had a blast.The box is bulky, takes up more room than necessary, wish the packing was more compact and practical."
This box of shopkins made my daughter very happy! We were satisfied with this purchase.
Love shopkins!!!!
Grand daughter loved it!
As described. I'm sure my niece will love it.
Not worth for money
Great selection only 3 baskets dupolicate
"Our daughter loves these, it was all she really cared for at xmas."
"Everything was great and after my granddaughter opened all the shopping carts ,there were only 8 duplicates in all."
This had a mix of all the items and a few rare ones too!
I have never opened one but I would like to.  My mom told me that they have to many duplicates I don't think that.  I really want to open one.
My granddaughter was so happy when she opened the package. I was satisfied with the product
Adamaris6
It was perfect
Love them
"Yes the product is overpriced, retail price is $2.99 for a basket of 2.However that shouldn't affect the rating of the product. These are nicely made and a lot of fun and a winner in our household."
way to overpriced. should be around $60
i love shopkins
Next year's Christmas present.  So I will let you know then.
great for ages 5-8 which is the ages of my grandchildren.  we are always looking for games where they are all included
My five year old grandson loves to play this game.  He asks me to join him for a round or two often.
My 4 year old loves this game! Wish there were more characters and different money denominations though.
"I purchased this for a birthday present for a little girl who loves Frozen.  I love monopoly Junior games, they are very much like the original monopoly but take less time and are much easier for children to play.  My boys, age 5 and 12 love to play monopoly junior and had no trouble figuring thegame out right away.  I recomend this to any Frozen or monopoly fan."
"I bought this for my five year old niece. We started playing regular monopoly to teach her money which she loved, but halfway through the game she would get bored and quit. I thought we would try the JR. Version. She picked Frozen because let's face it that's all the kids want. She is able to finish an entire game and learn about money. The best part is she can play with my 11 year old daughter and they both still enjoy it. The downside to this game is that they only deal with one dollars bills instead of varying amounts of money. The other problem is that it only comes with three token instead of the usual four that come with regular Monoploy Jr. Still we all love and are very happy!"
My daughters had fun playing this game.  It's a bit on the easy side but I guess that is what you expect with Junior games.
All the fun of Monopoly with the popular Frozen theme. My 7 year old daughter loves playing this game. She was so tickled to have a Monopoly game of her own.
"Game is as described.  A group of adults found it to be fairly dry and boring.  It is not as entertaining as the description made it out to be.  It is very much like a politically correct and non-offensive version of another card game (C.A.H.).  The disappointing part of the game is not the lack of ""offensiveness"".  It is the lack of imagination and a lack of congruence.  I suppose that with the right group, ""pleading a case"" for why a combination should or should not win might be fun, but for us it simply fell flat.  We packed it up and played games with plain, old-fashioned,  playing cards instead."
Our family loves this game.  I Hope more cards are being planned.
"Fun game to play with the family. My seven year old sometimes is a little frustrated because she doesn't understand who someone is or the definition of a word, but with help she is laughing and in on the game. Great way to learn people and vocabulary for younger ones."
Fun to play at parties or just with friends.
Tons of fun!  I bought the Scrabble game too & was equally impressed with Monopoly!  Would highly recommend!
My son collects monopoly games and has been wanting this one. It came when promised and he loves it. Thanks
"This is the game set to play ""strip Monopoly""......... For those elegant open fire evenings... you could not go wrong..."
Best edition of monopoly I've purchased to date! (I collect.) The board is very sturdy and the pieces are very elegant.
All the parts of the game and the game board are so nice and beautiful that make the game more inviting.
Nice board Money and pieces are all super tiny like they were made for grade schoolers but still all in all a nice board
Only reason i take away a star is the size of the game is a bit smaller than standard size. Granted the board itself doesn't fold in on itself. But i was expecting a standard size game.
"Hello everyone,The rumors about this being small are true. However, this does not detract from the game. If you are a non-collector and casual player and completely used to the normal board this may not be for you. For you monopoly collectors out there this is an excellent addition to your collection. Everything is about 5/8"" scale with the exception of the tokens/dice. I've got big hands and can still handle the money/chance-community cards/deed cards just fine. The board is decently crafted and offers elegant colors and playing surface. The silver lining is sleek; the cash holder is just plastic but looks great. The drawstring pouch for the tokens/dice is black velvet/felt (could never tell difference sorry).While in storage all the pieces have their own designated home within the box, flimsy but organized. I like this game and highly recommend. It's no Franklin Mint Monopoly but it's better than your average versions. Be sure to the The Heirloom Edition as well."
"I could not wait to get this game home, but very disappointed because it was just TOO SMALL, TOO SMALL.  If the board was just about 5 inches larger it would be great! I love the colors and the theme.  We hardly play it because of it's size.  I did not recommend it to some friends of ours because of the size.  This couple wear glasses and it just would not be good for them.  Please designers, you should have made the board larger and it would been a great seller!  I loved Black Onxy...but I wasted my money."
"This version is just ok. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased. EVERYTHING is ridiculously tiny and miniaturized, too small to handle, except the unusually larger dice. I never play this version and it ended up collecting dust in my closet."
Great game!
Such a great game. My family loves it. We played for hours. Don't for get people their are Apples to Apples for young kids. Enjoy. Great entertainment for all
"Fun, fun, fun. Lots of laughs and family fun."
Even my brother played!!
great game!
Fun game.
